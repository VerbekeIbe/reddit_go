Attractive people are being handed million dollar branding deals and getting millions upon millions of followers for literally staring at a camera. Absolutely no talent, skill or personality needed. Even if they do have skills I\u2019m sure having tons of validation and constant support helps you stay motivated. Everyone pretty much knows this but what really bothers me is these people don\u2019t even acknowledge how much it benefits them. They didn\u2019t get these things solely cause they \u201cworked hard\u201d, they got it because being physically attractive makes everything easier. When you\u2019re physically attractive you can pretty much do anything and people will forgive you. You can lack integrity, honesty, you can fuck people over, you can be creepy and get away with all of it. Even studies show that attractive people get way less severe punishments for the same crimes. All you have to do if you\u2019re attractive is not murder people and you\u2019re life is pretty much set on easy mode. Making friends and business connections will be a breeze, lame jokes you tell will come off as funnier, any weird or disturbing trait you possess will come off as cute and quirky, people may even give you stuff for free or invite you to exclusive events, simply because you\u2019re attractive. If you\u2019re attractive just know that you have been handed the good life on a golden platter. You can get by with one tenth the effort of the average person and still gain more respect for the same amount of work. The people who will truly understand what I mean are those who went from being conventionally ugly/below average to conventionally attractive\u2026 whether it was from puberty, weight loss, surgery, etc. The difference in how people treated you before and after is astounding to say the least. People who are born with it though will never truly understand how it influences almost every aspect of their life.\n\n\nEdit: Before anyone calls me out on sounding bitter, just know this also comes from my own personal experience from how I was treated before and after puberty and from what I see going on around me as well. What I\u2019m saying is nothing new, we all know this is going on but I feel this is becoming more and more apparent as the world we live in becomes more centered around appearances and garnering attention. I\u2019m not saying attractive people don\u2019t suffer but they do have easier access to opportunities that the average citizen does not.\n\n**EDIT2:** Okay so I\u2019m really enjoying the discussion this has brought up. Some people have brought up some interesting points that I would like to address. I just want to say that everyone\u2019s life has suffering no matter what you are blessed with. Hearing downsides to attractiveness like sexual assault, objectification, etc are also very real. I also want to point out that attractiveness doesn\u2019t guarantee success but more that it just contributes to being socially validated everywhere you go making it \u201cextremely easier for the chance at success\u201d. Of course everyone still has to put in effort. At the end of the day though, life is unfair and like a lot of people mentioned, we all need to play with cards we\u2019ve been dealt as best as we can. If you are \u201cunattractive\u201d I would say try everything out there to raise your odds like losing weight, exercising, grooming, etc. Once you\u2019ve maxed out this area it really is up to you to stand out in other ways. This may mean you have to put it in more work than some but that\u2019s just the way it is. At the end of the day, just try to be as grateful as possible for what you have because we\u2019re all going to die and none of this will matter lol.\n\n**EDIT3:** A Reddit commenter hjalex22 posted a real life example that explains EXACTLY what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n*\u201cThe epitome of this principle is Jeremy Meeks. Low life criminal is a member of crips of something, beats a kid to near death and lands himself in prison.  Police department posts his mugshot on Facebook for some reason and instantly recieves 100s of thousands of love letters as well as 1000s of dollars to post his bail.

Attractive people are being handed million dollar branding deals and getting millions upon millions of followers for literally staring at a camera. Absolutely no talent, skill or personality needed. Even if they do have skills I\u2019m sure having tons of validation and constant support helps you stay motivated. Everyone pretty much knows this but what really bothers me is these people don\u2019t even acknowledge how much it benefits them. They didn\u2019t get these things solely cause they \u201cworked hard\u201d, they got it because being physically attractive makes everything easier. When you\u2019re physically attractive you can pretty much do anything and people will forgive you. You can lack integrity, honesty, you can fuck people over, you can be creepy and get away with all of it. Even studies show that attractive people get way less severe punishments for the same crimes. All you have to do if you\u2019re attractive is not murder people and you\u2019re life is pretty much set on easy mode. Making friends and business connections will be a breeze, lame jokes you tell will come off as funnier, any weird or disturbing trait you possess will come off as cute and quirky, people may even give you stuff for free or invite you to exclusive events, simply because you\u2019re attractive. If you\u2019re attractive just know that you have been handed the good life on a golden platter. You can get by with one tenth the effort of the average person and still gain more respect for the same amount of work. The people who will truly understand what I mean are those who went from being conventionally ugly/below average to conventionally attractive\u2026 whether it was from puberty, weight loss, surgery, etc. The difference in how people treated you before and after is astounding to say the least. People who are born with it though will never truly understand how it influences almost every aspect of their life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Before anyone calls me out on sounding bitter, just know this also comes from my own personal experience from how I was treated before and after puberty and from what I see going on around me as well. What I\u2019m saying is nothing new, we all know this is going on but I feel this is becoming more and more apparent as the world we live in becomes more centered around appearances and garnering attention. I\u2019m not saying attractive people don\u2019t suffer but they do have easier access to opportunities that the average citizen does not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT2:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay so I\u2019m really enjoying the discussion this has brought up. Some people have brought up some interesting points that I would like to address. I just want to say that everyone\u2019s life has suffering no matter what you are blessed with. Hearing downsides to attractiveness like sexual assault, objectification, etc are also very real. I also want to point out that attractiveness doesn\u2019t guarantee success but more that it just contributes to being socially validated everywhere you go making it \u201cextremely easier for the chance at success\u201d. Of course everyone still has to put in effort. At the end of the day though, life is unfair and like a lot of people mentioned, we all need to play with cards we\u2019ve been dealt as best as we can. If you are \u201cunattractive\u201d I would say try everything out there to raise your odds like losing weight, exercising, grooming, etc. Once you\u2019ve maxed out this area it really is up to you to stand out in other ways. This may mean you have to put it in more work than some but that\u2019s just the way it is. At the end of the day, just try to be as grateful as possible for what you have because we\u2019re all going to die and none of this will matter lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT3:&lt;/strong&gt; A Reddit commenter hjalex22 posted a real life example that explains EXACTLY what I\u2019m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cThe epitome of this principle is Jeremy Meeks. Low life criminal is a member of crips of something, beats a kid to near death and lands himself in prison.  Police department posts his mugshot on Facebook for some reason and instantly recieves 100s of thousands of love letters as well as 1000s of dollars to post his bail. He gets out and lands multiple modelling gigs and is now a multi millionaire and model. The worst part is he believes he got where he is by &amp;quot;working hard&amp;quot;. This man lives like a king constantly being fawned over by women and it&amp;#39;s all because it was written in his DNA. There is no justice  in this world. If there was, he would still be in prison with nothing in life.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.

He was such a sweet boy, loved everyone and I took him everywhere with me for the first 4 years of his life.\n\nOne night, I was drugged by someone we knew. My sweet boy was locked in his crate, in plain sight of everything. This fucking asshole even invited someone, and I still don\u2019t know who it was and it fucking rips me apart. My sweet dog turned into a monster, his face was ripped and his gums were swollen because he was trying to get out. \n\nToday I had to break him from another lunge/ snarl/ bite cycle from our nice neighbor with his super sweet German shepherd. Taking him for walks is so exhausting. Taking him to the dog park is out of the equation. He is a border collie golden retriever mix, everyone wants to pet him and I always have to say no. I have to put him away when new people come to our house. He\u2019s on Prozac and trazedone and gabbapentin, it doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve read the books, paid professionals, talked to the vet, tried everything I can think of. He\u2019s never bit anyone. When it\u2019s just us, he\u2019s the same dog he\u2019s always been. He\u2019s been mine for almost 9 years now, through all of my 20s, the birth of my daughter. He\u2019s so sweet to all children, messes with the cat all day but has never hurt her in his life (had her longer). He\u2019s not actually aggressive he\u2019s just still so fucking scared of men and it makes me feel so fucked in the head. He had ribbons, he visited veterans, stayed with me always. He was such a sweet boy. And it\u2019s so hard to heal from it when this just keeps reminding me how we both broke that night.\n\nETA: I have gotten some really good advice since posting and I want to say thank you to all of you who took the time to respond in a kind manner. I don\u2019t need to defend myself but I will on two points here: \n1. This happened five years ago, my daughter is 3.5. I no longer drink after this incident happened, I definitely did not have my daughter with me or being babysat for me to have an irresponsible time. I would also like to touch on this on behalf of other women, we as a society need to fix the victim blaming cycle. It shouldn\u2019t matter what I was doing, wearing, or what neighborhood I was in at the time. Over 40% of women have experienced sexual violence, remember that next time you look at the women in your life. Less than 20% of rapes are reported because of what happens when others find out and don\u2019t believe you. 1 in 6 women will be rapped ANNUALLY in the US. Over 80% of sexual assaults are committed by an acquaintance. \n2. My dog was a rescue who was already well adapted to his crate. I didn\u2019t close the door anymore at that point, he just would pace and pace and howl until I put it back up because he had a blanket over top and would go in there like it was his own little house. He still shoves himself in tight spaces to lay down, he prefers it. Those of you who took this post as an argument against crates probably have never used one. It\u2019s not something you force them into, that would be abusive. It was his little fort, he was very attached to it, I did take the door off after this happened and phased it out over time because I couldn\u2019t look at it anymore.

We've had our ups and downs, but we have stuck together through thick and thin. Always been able to talk about anything, disagree constructively, enjoy shitty movies and laugh together about anything. She was empathetic, kind, selfless, and understanding.\n\n\nUntil the past 2-3 years or so. \n\n\nShe's changed dramatically from the person I knew, to someone completely different. She's mean to her ex who she still lives with, then calls him abusive for blowing up at her. Of course he's going to blow up at his *ex girlfriend* who has been living with him *for free* when she is antagonistic, rude, and overall just shitty to him. This is a very, very small portion of the shittiness she has been displaying. She says she's understanding and kind to him, but then I see the texts she sends him.... They aren't either of those things.\n\n\nAnd then she gets mad at me and says maybe we can't be friends when I point out that maybe the stress of living with his antagonistic ex girlfriend might have something to do with the outbursts.\n\n\nPlus, she says she needs my support. But I don't know how to do that. I'm autistic. I have tried all the ways of offering support I can think of but I just can't figure out what she wants from me. She literally asked me to be supportive while saying that we can have differing opinions, but I can't question what her reality is.

They aren&amp;#39;t either of those things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then she gets mad at me and says maybe we can&amp;#39;t be friends when I point out that maybe the stress of living with his antagonistic ex girlfriend might have something to do with the outbursts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, she says she needs my support.

The only thing I was slightly irritated about was that my mom was going out about my niece how she's having to watch her and that's not the problem it's just like she's a little upset that the babies upset because that we don't know why she's cranky she just is.\n\nSo my mom thinks I'm all pissed off that I have to work today and I'm like not at all I'm actually on the other hand happy. I finally have a job and I'm happy that I can go to work and stuff. My mother doesn't understand what I'm actually annoyed about is my niece. She's just at 6 months old and she cries about literally everything and I know that's how babies are and I know that you sort of just have to live with it kind of thing but I'm over here like I don't have to I'm not uncle I can leave. I have no responsibility whatsoever and my mom basically doesn't like when I bring that up.\n\nSo she finally accepted it today that I don't want children. I just don't want the responsibility. I want my money to be my money and I don't want to throw money at the wall basically wondering if it's going to stick. I think to myself hey let's put my kid in karate oh well he didn't like it and it was too hard but to try something else. Oh he wants to do gymnastics oh he doesn't like gymnastics but put him in something else. Oh let's get him a bike that he's only going to ride three times a week if that maybe he'll ride three times a month.\n\nIf I've learned anything about children is that they're the most selfish individuals possible and they just want something in the moment. Honestly you know we should do, all the things they want we should have like rental services for this kind of stuff like they want it for a certain amount of time and when you're done you can take it back and you get a refund or partial refund. The only wanted to write a bike for like a weekend and then they never want to write it again you just go ahead and take it back.\n\nAnd then I think about every single time that I've ever gotten in trouble at school and my mom had to show up where every time I screwed something up in the house and my dad would get pissed off. I think to myself I don't want to be that person. I don't want to be the person that's getting pissed off at my children for doing something stupid. Let's face it, although our parents love us to death or we may love our children to death or our nieces and nephews, we know that they're all idiots and we're idiots in general. We're all adults that are reading this supposedly and we're looking at this thinking wow we are stupid.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do enjoy being an uncle from time to time. I love my nieces and nephews profusely. There's nothing I wouldn't do for them. I hear this thump sound The other day and I hear my sister scream like in this bloody murder scared oh my God something's terrible going on. Then I hear my niece crying. I run in there ASAP out of bed to check on her and my sister's crying but my niece is fine she fell off the bed but she's okay. Scared the shit out of me scared to show my sister.\n\nIt's not that I don't care about our future or anything like that, it's more like I just don't really care that much. I just don't care about humans in general anymore. Over the last couple of years I've become missing topic with reality and people like and I'm just like I don't really care. I'm just glad my mom finally took the hint that I don't want children. I'd rather be 60 years old and my niece is nephews caring about me than some children that are probably have to waste a shitload of money on. I don't know if I'm making sense.

The only wanted to write a bike for like a weekend and then they never want to write it again you just go ahead and take it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I think about every single time that I&amp;#39;ve ever gotten in trouble at school and my mom had to show up where every time I screwed something up in the house and my dad would get pissed off. I think to myself I don&amp;#39;t want to be that person. I don&amp;#39;t want to be the person that&amp;#39;s getting pissed off at my children for doing something stupid. Let&amp;#39;s face it, although our parents love us to death or we may love our children to death or our nieces and nephews, we know that they&amp;#39;re all idiots and we&amp;#39;re idiots in general. We&amp;#39;re all adults that are reading this supposedly and we&amp;#39;re looking at this thinking wow we are stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I do enjoy being an uncle from time to time. I love my nieces and nephews profusely. There&amp;#39;s nothing I wouldn&amp;#39;t do for them. I hear this thump sound The other day and I hear my sister scream like in this bloody murder scared oh my God something&amp;#39;s terrible going on. Then I hear my niece crying. I run in there ASAP out of bed to check on her and my sister&amp;#39;s crying but my niece is fine she fell off the bed but she&amp;#39;s okay. Scared the shit out of me scared to show my sister.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that I don&amp;#39;t care about our future or anything like that, it&amp;#39;s more like I just don&amp;#39;t really care that much. I just don&amp;#39;t care about humans in general anymore. Over the last couple of years I&amp;#39;ve become missing topic with reality and people like and I&amp;#39;m just like I don&amp;#39;t really care. I&amp;#39;m just glad my mom finally took the hint that I don&amp;#39;t want children. I&amp;#39;d rather be 60 years old and my niece is nephews caring about me than some children that are probably have to waste a shitload of money on. I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m making sense. I&amp;#39;m just happy my mom finally got on board&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": true, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2yuqy", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "s28osr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tarrabyte__", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/s28osr/im_not_having_kids_and_my_mother_finally_accepted/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/s28osr/im_not_having_kids_and_my_mother_finally_accepted/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1141331, "created_utc": 1642000699.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "selftext": "Its ok to be a non-English speaker, nobody is judging you, english is global now.

We all know that someone having sex with a super drunk person is unacceptable especially if they\u2019re AWARE of how drunk they are. \n\n\nDo not support this behavior, cannot believe I have to even say this.

He needs a new girlfriend.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And \u201cyou just got to drunk, he didn\u2019t assault you, many couples have drunk sex.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She then gets downvoted for replying \u201che deserves a new girlfriend because I\u2019m uncomfortable that he had sex with me while I was in that state?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m disgusted. Just because that\u2019s her boyfriend, that doesn\u2019t mean what he did was okay. What if this was a stranger? Her choosing to drink makes him not guilty?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What gets me the most is it didn\u2019t seem like anyone read it fully. She mentions \u201capparently it was the most intense sex we\u2019ve ever had. I just don\u2019t remember it.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And someone said \u201chow were you black out if it was the most intense sex?\u201d Like dude\u2026 she literally said \u201cApparently\u201d meaning coming from her boyfriends mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would be acceptable if they were both plastered. But she wakes up to him laughing, and he was sober enough to remember everything and recall \u201chow drunk she was.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disgusted is an understatement. This poor girl is now probably thinking this behavior is okay. Someone being your Boyfriend doesn\u2019t = always consenting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re that drunk that you don\u2019t remember, she was obviously gonna be acting it. We all know that someone having sex with a super drunk person is unacceptable especially if they\u2019re AWARE of how drunk they are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not support this behavior, cannot believe I have to even say this. Your significant other should be taking care of you, making sure you okay if you\u2019re that wasted. Not trying to fuck you. Gross. I feel sick.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": true, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": true, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2yuqy", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "s1s9ej", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "yellowbrickroad23", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 101, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "promo_adult_nsfw", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/s1s9ej/what_is_wrong_some_people_these_days/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/s1s9ej/what_is_wrong_some_people_these_days/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1141331, "created_utc": 1641947355.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "selftext": "Using a throwaway for privacy\n\n\n\nI hope this is the right sub but if it isn't appropriate please let me know.

Not one to frequent my place of work but we do see well off people getting rid of good items form time to time. She came to my counter looking to pawn some jewellery. The jewellery she had was top end stuff. 3ct diamond rings 22ct gold neckalces. Really good sapphires Ruby etc. She was looking for a buy back pawn option and wanted about \u00a31.5k for the lot. We had to take it to our expert who firmed the worth. It was worth about 2.5k in total so her asking for 1.5k was reasonable and with approval from upper management we bought it. Thought nothing of it and moved on to the next customer.\n\nA month later she comes in again with more jewellery. Again our expert assessed and worth about 3k, she wanted 2k. We were like great here is your money we can make that back. As our pawn works on a 10% buy back within 6 months. If they come in and buy it back its what we paid plus 10% and after 6 months we could do what we want with it.\n\nThat happened every month for about a year. Soemtimes it was valued at 2k sometime up to 6k. Sometimes she would come in with equally well dressed good looking early 20s and each time someone different.\n\nWe started to make up stories, who is she, what does she do. Our best guess either she was rich and bored with the jewellery and wanted cash or the most concrete back story, at least in our minds, was she was a high end escort and she was paid in expensive jewellery. Both never made actual sense but we saw all sorts of characters in our shop and unfortunately the most negative story was usually the correct one.\n\nSo after a year she stopped coming in. Manager was a bit upset as she never wanted her jewellery back so we could always make a really good profit on her items. Our days of being No1 in Pawn buying every month was finally over. I served her every time and was slightly concerned she hadn't been in. We had our regulas but she was always nice and happy to have a chat and one of my positive interactions on my job.\n\nAbout 3 months pass. I was working the cash counter and our manager was working a different store when suddenly a well dressed middle aged man burst into the shop came up to me and started screaming for the manager, our assistant manager come up and asks whats up. Suddenly she appears with bright red eyes, mascara down her face and didn't look her normal well dressed self, she was in joggers and a hoodie and looked like she has just been through an ordeal.\n\nSo myself and the assistant manager asked the man to calm down, which only made him more irate until we threatened to call the police. He calmed down and asked that the shop be shut for a couple of minutes while he said what he wanted to say.\n\nTurns out the girl was his daughter and had been stealing her mother's jewellery and pawning it off so she could go partying. Her father only found out when his wife went to find the gold necklace with the sapphire and couldn't find it, then searched for other items and couldn't find them too. When the dad went to call the police she confessed and had a massive row and then came straight to the shop still in this emotional state.\n\nHe asked how much she had pawned off. Total \u00a330,500 (value of all the items was around \u00a365k). He went crazy again until we again said we would call the police if he didn't calm down. \n\nHe asked if he could get the items back. \n\nWe said that he would have to buy them back. Again went into a rage and this was his final warning about calling the police. He said he wanted all his items back now and we said he would have to file a police report to seize the items and then go though the procedures with his daughter most likely getting into trouble for stealing \u00a365k worth of jewellery and selling it signing papers it was hers to sell. He said ok he would like to buy it all back.\n\nWe said some items have expired and that they were either sold or in this shop and others on displa or in our HQ safe. He asked how much he can get back. We had about 20k worth of jewellery in the safe so said right now he could get that back for 22k the we called maager but he didn't pick up so called HQ they said rest would have to be bought at retail if we still had it. We had all but about 4k worth of jewellery somewhere in our company and most of that was standard neckalces rings. Total cost to buy all items was c\u00a351k. He paused for a second, looked at his daughter as if to think if he should pay or get it back for free snd let her get into trouble. \n\nHe got a card out and said I'll pay for everything now and be back in tomorrow for the rest. They both left the shop and I never saw them again as the next day I was off and there was no chance I was going into the store that day.\n\nManager was racing back to the store as this was happening and got back and was told the full story. He was so happy, we just made as a shop made 20k in profit on jewellery in one day. I was astounded that all he could think about was the money, not how me and the assistant manager were after the ordeal just how much money we made.\n\nTurns out so did HQ. We were made the best shop of the year and my manager had a little article in the monthly newsletter. I hated myself, hated this job now as the fact we just buy anything and fund whatever, keep people in debt and be basically where the desperate go. But I still needed money so I carried on until the day before payday. \n\nOur manager came to me and said good news. Because you bought all the jewellery and technically sold it all, you are getting a \u00a3250 bonus as as we won shop of the year everyone get a \u00a350 gift card. \n\nI realised I unknowingly helped destroy that family, by not even stopping to think that this is a lot of jewellery something is not right about it. The fact even if I raised that concern my manager wouldn't care less. How many other lives have I made miserable by funding habits, buying stolen precious items. The fact that I got paid extra was the turning point.\n\nI got rewarded for making people miserable.

many things built up over time that made me finally decide to leave him. this is my rant about a few of the things i brought up as reasons for the break up\nwe had gotten together july of 2019, we met off a dating app but instantly clicked. we had a lot in common, we grew up in the same area, had some of the same family problems, acted the same etc. we basically move in together a week after we met, it wasn\u2019t in purpose i went there one day and kinda just never left. we never had arguments, never fought never had a bad moment.  \nabout a year and a half into our relationship i start to notice things i didn\u2019t before. like how when i talked about wanting to move to another state? oh absolutely not, he would shut me down so fast and tell me how stupid of an idea that is\nor how when ever he talked about wanting kids, i always said i didn\u2019t want any. never have never will want them, but he would always tell me \u2018we\u2019re going to have kids, what do you mean?\u2019 and basically tell me i was going to have kids even tho i didn\u2019t want them\nfor 2 1/2 years years i dealt with having to put everything he wanted first. when i was feeling overwhelmed from my job because i work over 50 hours a week i couldn\u2019t talk to him about my day because it stressed him out. but he could talk about his day at his job, which wasn\u2019t actually a job it was fucking doordash when he was more than capable of having an actual job with a reliable paycheck. for 2 1/2 years he didn\u2019t have a job only doordash and then he worked at a restaurant for 5 months then quit. \ni did everything to try and make him happy, because he had a shitty childhood same as i did and i wanted to do anything i could to not make him feel like shit. i would stay up and help him fall asleep, i would wake up in the middle of the night to him shaking me cause he\u2019s having bad anxiety, i would always be there for him to rant to about his mother, when ever he had anxiety or panic attacks i was always there. i know it doesn\u2019t sound like much but it was just about every single day. i would tell him he should go to therapy and then he\u2019d get upset with me for even suggesting it\noh and sexually just to throw this in too i did my best to play on his kinks which where things i wasnt really comfortable with like me sleeping with another man or multiple men at once and him watch/record it or how he also started talking about my best friend saying she\u2019s so hot and how it would be so hot if i fucked her and sent him videos. i didn\u2019t like those, at all but he always brought them when we were having sex. but he never wanted to try any of the things i liked, choking, spanking, degrading etc the list is longer but even those simpler ones he wouldn\u2019t do or if he did it was so so soft. i would even tell him he can be rougher but he never would. but what he would do if anytime i didn\u2019t want to have sex and i\u2019d say no he would beg and plead with me to have sex and when i would say no i wasn\u2019t in the mood or no i\u2019m tired he would get all upset and wine and pout till i gave in or he\u2019d cuddle up behind me in shed and squeeze my ass or hips and whisper about how hard he was and grind up into my ass till i gave in. \ni could never hang out with friends, i would wake up around 9am get ready for work and leave about 12pm all while he\u2019s still sleeping. he wakes up between 1pm-4pm everyday then goes to door dash from6-9pm then goes to the house. i get off work around 10:30pm then i head to the house and smoke with a friend that lives 3 minutes away we talk and smoke and then i head in about 11:30(the drive to work is about 17 mins) and get a lecture about smoking with other people and how he doesn\u2019t like it taking so long. so on my off days i\u2019d try to smoke with friends then and he would still get upset cause i was smoking with friends for so long when i would be gone maybe 2 hours and it wasn\u2019t like i was smoking with other guys it was all females who he always said he never felt threatened by cause \u2018he knew i\u2019d never end up with a woman\u2019 which was dumb cause i had told him after he had asked that i think i do have a preference for women rather than men. \nhe is still, a week later calling and texting me from 10am till 4am spamming every single fucking day and it all of my social media too. my phone has been on mute, silent, do not disturb for the past week because of him. if i don\u2019t respond he threatens to come to where i live or work and see if i\u2019m there. he says it cause he\u2019s worried about me but i know he\u2019s just paranoid about me having relationships that aren\u2019t him. not even romantic relations just normal fuckin friends. he even came to my work and sat outside for over 7 hours waiting for me one night just cause he wanted to talk but how that talk went was him holding onto my car begging me not to leave and then when i do drive off he scream that he\u2019s \u2018going to fucking kill himself without me\u2019 then he punches his truck and breaks two fingers\ni\u2019ve told him all of this, many many times but he doesn\u2019t seem to understand that i\u2019m so done. i tried to talk to him when we were still together about how i was feeling and express that i didn\u2019t like certain things but he always kept doing them. he never seemed to remember the things i didn\u2019t like. \nhe told me i couldn\u2019t just leave like that, that this isn\u2019t the way i\u2019m suppose to handle adult relationship then proceeds to say \u2018i\u2019m glad i was just a place holder for you just like every other woman ive been with\u2019\n\nlike this wasn\u2019t fucking easy for me are you kidding me? this has been my longest relationship and i did really really love him but at some point i just started falling out of love and i knew i had to end it. maybe that is selfish maybe i am selfish but i feel like i shouldn\u2019t dread going to the house and seeing him once i\u2019m off work. \n\nbut here\u2019s my rant, feel free to ask any questions or comment any opinions i\u2019ll

hours and it wasn\u2019t like i was smoking with other guys it was all females who he always said he never felt threatened by cause \u2018he knew i\u2019d never end up with a woman\u2019 which was dumb cause i had told him after he had asked that i think i do have a preference for women rather than men. \nhe is still, a week later calling and texting me from 10am till 4am spamming every single fucking day and it all of my social media too. my phone has been on mute, silent, do not disturb for the past week because of him. if i don\u2019t respond he threatens to come to where i live or work and see if i\u2019m there. he says it cause he\u2019s worried about me but i know he\u2019s just paranoid about me having relationships that aren\u2019t him. not even romantic relations just normal fuckin friends. he even came to my work and sat outside for over 7 hours waiting for me one night just cause he wanted to talk but how that talk went was him holding onto my car begging me not to leave and then when i do drive off he scream that he\u2019s \u2018going to fucking kill himself without me\u2019 then he punches his truck and breaks two fingers\ni\u2019ve told him all of this, many many times but he doesn\u2019t seem to understand that i\u2019m so done. i tried to talk to him when we were still together about how i was feeling and express that i didn\u2019t like certain things but he always kept doing them. he never seemed to remember the things i didn\u2019t like. \nhe told me i couldn\u2019t just leave like that, that this isn\u2019t the way i\u2019m suppose to handle adult relationship then proceeds to say \u2018i\u2019m glad i was just a place holder for you just like every other woman ive been with\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;like this wasn\u2019t fucking easy for me are you kidding me? this has been my longest relationship and i did really really love him but at some point i just started falling out of love and i knew i had to end it. maybe that is selfish maybe i am selfish but i feel like i shouldn\u2019t dread going to the house and seeing him once i\u2019m off work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but here\u2019s my rant, feel free to ask any questions or comment any opinions i\u2019ll respond to people when i\u2019m able to&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,
