The schedule spans the entire year so be sure to keep an eye out each month.\n\nThis month's 30-day challenge is to **get on top of your credit.** Here are some concrete steps you can take:\n\n# Check your free credit report\n\nThere are three major credit bureaus in the US: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. These companies each gather credit histories for individuals and sell that information to credit card companies, lenders, and other financial institutions.\n\nYou can go to https://www.annualcreditreport.com to get a credit report from each credit bureau once per year. It's often recommended to stagger your requests so you can get one every four months so you may only want to request one report at this time. You can use a calendar reminder to stay on top of this.\n\nNow, your free credit report won't include your score and it also won't include credit monitoring, but you absolutely don't need to buy those from a credit bureau because there are free options. See below.\n\nNote that the security questions will sometimes ask about intentionally false information (e.g. made-up loans), so \"none of the above\" may be the right answer. If you can't get past the security questions, you may have to write in to get your report. Also be aware that you don't have to pay for anything on the credit bureau sites. If you find yourself prompted for a credit card number, you might have clicked to sign up for something you might not need or want.\n\nAlso, if you have trouble with the web site, try temporarily disabling browser ad-blockers and privacy extensions.\n\nSee the [Credit Reports Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_reports) for more information!\n\n# Sign up for free credit monitoring\n\nYou don't need to pay for credit monitoring. Some options:\n\n* A variety of companies such as [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) and [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) offer free credit monitoring services. [There's a longer list of options in our Wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico#wiki_how_can_i_get_my_fico_score_or_a_score_estimate_for_free.3F)\n\n* Many employers also offer free credit monitoring for their employees directly with a credit bureau. Check with your benefits department.\n\n* Finally, if you've been the victim of a data breach like Target or Anthem, those companies are providing free credit monitoring for anyone potentially affected.\n\nAfter exploring your options, sign up with at least one of them. More information contained in the [Credit Scoring Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico).\n\n# Find out your credit score\n\nYou can now [get your FICO score for free from Discover](https://www.creditscorecard.com/) without a credit card.\n\nIn addition, a number of credit cards actually give you a free FICO score as a benefit of having their card. Brands providing FICO scores include Discover, Citi (branded cards only), American Express, Bank of America, and Barclaycard. [Here's a full list of options.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico#wiki_how_can_i_get_my_fico_score_or_a_score_estimate_for_free.3F)\n\nIn addition, you can get your VantageScore from [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) or [Mint](https://www.mint.com/). VantageScore is used less often by creditors than FICO, but it's a *usually* a good estimate of your FICO score. Paying for your credit score is silly unless you're considering getting a major loan like a mortgage.\n\n# Get rid of pre-approved credit card junk mail\n\n[OptOutPrescreen.Com](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/) is the official consumer credit card reporting website to opt-out of offers of credit or insurance. It's an easy win to reduce junk mail and reduce the risk of identity theft (from someone stealing your mail). I recommend signing up unless you're in the process of building credit and actually want to receive pre-approved offers.\n\n# Are you looking to improve your credit?\n\nOnce you have a score over 740, most credit files are solid enough to qualify for prime rate lending. This means that any additional increase of your score will likely not get you better credit products.\n\nIf you are in a position where you'd like to improve your credit, here are two situations that often befall people when asking for help here:\n\n* [\"I have no credit, and I am looking to get started.\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_no_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_get_started.)\n* [\"I have bad credit, and I am looking to repair it.\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_bad_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_repair_it.)\n\n# What to do if you find information you don't recognize\n\nEven though credit reporting is automated, mistakes can still occur. The most common errors can involve names and addresses. If your name is similar to a parent's name, there are also instances where a line of credit is reported on the wrong file.\n\nThe simplest course of action is to dispute the information with the bureaus. Here are direct links to initiate a dispute:\n\n* [Equifax](https://experian.referral.equifax.com/CreditInvestigation/home.action)\n* [Experian](http://www.experian.com/disputes/main.html)\n* [TransUnion](https://onlinedispute.transunion.com/disputewizard/)\n\nFinally, if you believe you've had your identity stolen, read and follow the steps in our **[Identity Theft Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft)**.\n\n# If you're not in the United States\n\n[The PF wiki has many more countries covered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_reports#wiki_what_if_i.27m_not_in_the_united_states.3F) If you would like to add information for your country to the wiki, please message the moderation team.\n\n# Challenge success criteria\n\nYou've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 3 or more of the following things:\n\n* Requested a free credit report via annualcreditreport.com\n* Set a reminder to request a different credit report in 4 months\n* Found out your credit score (either FICO or VantageScore)\n* Signed up for free credit monitoring\n* Opted out of pre-screened offers\n* Initiated a credit dispute with one or more credit bureaus\n\nIf you're outside of the US, you've successfully completed this challenge once you've done the following things:\n\n* Read up on whether there is a credit scoring system in your country and find out how it works (see the previous section and also try searching the internet).\n* If it exists, find out how you can get information about your own report or score or whatever it's called, get that information if possible, and check it for accuracy.\n* If there are items on there that you can try to fix, start doing so.

I may get a promotion and to do it after may be awkward, if I do it before it may affect my review (although I highly doubt this). &lt;strong&gt;Any thoughts on when the best time to give notice would be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if I&amp;#39;m not employed with this company before the bonus hits my bank account then I won&amp;#39;t get the bonus so that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m even staying until March.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": true, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "s1tg83", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mecca_f", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 167, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/personalfinance/comments/s1tg83/should_i_quit_my_job_before_during_or_after_my/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/s1tg83/should_i_quit_my_job_before_during_or_after_my/", "subreddit_subscribers": 15219574, "created_utc": 1641950597.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "personalfinance", "selftext": "Sharing this news as it relates to health insurance a frequent topic here on PF...\n\n[https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/10/biden-harris-administration-requires-insurance-companies-group-health-plans-to-cover-cost-at-home-covid-19-tests-increasing-access-free-tests.html](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/10/biden-harris-administration-requires-insurance-companies-group-health-plans-to-cover-cost-at-home-covid-19-tests-increasing-access-free-tests.html)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs): [https://www.cms.gov/how-to-get-your-at-home-OTC-COVID-19-test-for-free](https://www.cms.gov/how-to-get-your-at-home-OTC-COVID-19-test-for-free)\n\nBeginning January 15, 2022, individuals with private health insurance coverage or covered by a group health plan who purchase an over-the-counter COVID-19 diagnostic test authorized, cleared, or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be able to have those test costs covered by their plan or insurance. **Insurance companies and health plans are required to cover 8 free over-the-counter at-home tests per covered individual per month**.

This year is the year she will succeed and have 0 debt - no car payment, no credit cards, etc. Rent has gone up so much in the last couple of years, she's considering alternative options. Let me give you some details about her....\n\nShe's single; has one elderly cat and does not want any more pets; loves to be near the city (not a big city) and work; works from home 90% of the time; has 0 handyman skills, but does have my fiance and I that can do almost anything; She has never owned a home before; currently rents a 2br apartment at $630 per month and is month-to-month. Her credit is excellent and her salary is near 50K. She does not have retirement though.\n\nShe just received an email that rent will be going up an additional $145 per month ($775 total) and they are requiring 12 month leases from now on. I suggested she try to sign before the $145 goes in effect and she said they will not; she would have to sign at the higher rate. She isn't quite out of debt yet, so she thinks she will be signing a 12 month lease to go ahead and finish getting out of debt then considering what her next steps will be. She would like a place to live with 2 bedrooms.\n\nHere are some of the thoughts she has considered:\n\n* Buying a NEW mobile or modular home and\n   * Either buying a small lot of land to put it on or\n   * Putting it on my land (more details below)\n* Buying a house\n* Continuing renting\n\nSo let's go into more details about the possibility of her purchasing a mobile or modular home. She does not want to go in a 'trailer park'. She would like to either buy a lot of land or possibly put it on my land. She does not like that I live out of the city by 20 minutes, but it would be free for her once set up. However, she would need to have a septic line dug to connect to my septic, water line to mine or a new one, and would need to have electricty hooked up. I have two electricity hookups on my property, one is to my main house and apartment and the second goes to my sheds but I have it disconnected so she could use that one and be on her own separate meter. I also don't have a trailer pad so she'd need that too. She fears that I could miss my mortgage payments or go into foreclosure and she would be screwed because her home was on my land. I told her even though that is very unlikely, if it DID happen she could just move her mobile home elsewhere.\n\nIf she were to buy a lot of land, she asked me if the loan could be combined into one loan - for her to buy a mobile/modular home, a lot of land, and have all of the connection and setup costs put in to one large loan. I said I have no idea. I told her I knew there were loans for building new houses, but I didn't know if those could work for this. Lots of land around here are quite cheap - 20K-50K according to size and location.\n\nNext would to be buying an existing house, not modular or mobile home. Housing prices in the areas she is looking at are around 150K-200K for what she wants. She does not want to live in a \"low quality neighborhood\" or far out of town. The pros are she wouldn't have to pay for a lot of hookups and construction, but the cons are you never know when something is going to break when it's not brand new and under warranty. I suggested that regardless of what she does (buying a new or existing home) she needs to get a home warranty for the first year at least.\n\nFinally, she could just continue renting. However, she did say she will not be moving to find a cheaper rent - if she moves, she wants it to be into a 'permanent' home that she is buying and that is hers. She hates moving and doesn't want to keep repeating this every 2-3 years.\n\nNow, I'd like Reddit's advice and wisdom. I just went through the process of buying a home and so I know some of it and want to help her out, but I know there's far more than what I know, and I know enough to know that I made some serious mistakes when buying my home that I don't want her to make. Here are some of the bits of knowledge and advice I've given her...\n\n1. There are first time home buyer loans and downpayment assistant loans that she may qualify for. She does not have a downpayment saved.\n2. She will need to buy home insurance on top of the mortgage - and it costs more than renters insurance.\n3. Home warranty is different than home insurance, but I believe that not-new homes need a home warranty for at least a year to help with unexpected break downs.\n4. It is more difficult to buy a used mobile home on land - and most banks want to finance it as a 20 year or less loan rather than a 30 year conventional, but it isn't impossible, as that's what mine is financed as.\n\nHere are some questions she and I have....\n\n1. Can she get a loan to cover buying a mobile/modular home and associated costs of hookup, connections, and construction? Can she also include buying land in that same loan?\n2. In the grand scheme of things, is buying a place going to cost more in repairs, insurance, and anything else than it would be to just continue renting?\n\nWill add more as I think of it... thanks in advanced!", "author_fullname": "t2_xp2yl", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Advice for my mother - to rent or to buy?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "Housing", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_s2747e", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Housing", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1641996536.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.personalfinance", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since my mother divorced my father, she has spent years working hard to get out of debt.

I am looking to refi my car just because I would like to lower payments/interest rate. I contacted my CU that I have been with for YEARS and they approved me at a higher rate than I already have with another CU and a longer term. I asked them about what caused my rate to be so high, as I do have pretty good credit, pulling around a 780. They stated it was due to limited credit experience? A little confused as I do have:\n\nA credit card that has $12,000 limit, I have had it for 4 years, no missed payments. Balance is around $1000 at the time of credit pulling\n\nA revolving line of credit I have had for 2/3 years, never missed a payment and has $3000 limit, around $600 left at time of pulling.\n\nA car loan, only a year and a half old, never missed a payment and pay extra every month. Paid off around $2500 already.\n\nA student loan, have had for about a year but payments are deferred due to COVID. Now first payment isnt until May, I believe?\n\nThey stated its because that is all I have, but Im not trying to open another credit card just because I want to refinance my car.
