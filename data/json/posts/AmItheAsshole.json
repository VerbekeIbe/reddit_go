Resident bot programmer [Phteven](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/014/409/phteven.JPG) here to announce the next AITA Reddit Talk.\n\n# [What is Reddit Talk?](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404349195284-What-is-Reddit-Talk-#:~:text=Reddit%20Talk%20is%20a%20new,that%20any%20redditor%20can%20join.)\n\nBasically it's a live call-in radio type thing where the AITA community can judge each other in real time. What could go wrong? So far, not *too* much.\n\nWe've hosted 2 of these sessions so far with tens of thousands of you participating and it's been a blast. \n\nWith that said, the next AITA Talk will take place this Thursday, 1/13 at 4PM Eastern, 9PM UTC. \n\n# How it works\n\nLog in to the official Reddit App and join the /r/AmItheAsshole subreddit. You should get a notification when the Talk goes live on Thursday, but if you aren't notified, check this sticky for a direct link. \n\nThis go-round, we will be selecting random people from the community to help judge the Assholes. If you would like to be on the judging committee, once you join the Talk, simply press the little hand icon to \"raise your hand\" and volunteer. You will be granted permission to speak on the app and can voice your opinion on the asshole in question.\n\nWhile the asshole is making their case, everyone listening will be able to vote on whether they think the speaker is the asshole in the situation or not. Once we have heard from the audience volunteers, the Judgment bot will tally the votes and we will render a live verdict. \n\n# Want to make your case live? \n\n## Please submit your \"Am I the Asshole?\" stories here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrsXlUtC5vI_qFMRbUKC-wXK1gs6RNfOgikPS0heIaynH5-A/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\nIf you would like to share your situation and be judged live, join the Talk on Thursday and raise your hand so we can bring you up to speak. \n\nPlease keep in mind we will not be able to select any situations which break the subreddit rules. This includes but is not limited to:\n\n* Relationship drama\n* Stories involving violence of any kind\n* Stories with no interpersonal conflict\n\n\nPlease note that Reddit Talk is an experimental feature created by the Admins of reddit.com and not something we made. We were invited to test it out and while it's a lot of fun, it is also still in development so there may be some minor technical hiccups. Any complaints about the service or feature requests should be directed to the admins in /r/reddittalk. \n\nThank you to all of you who make this community so fun to participate in. See you Thursday! \n\n\n---\n\n\nIf you are looking for the AITA Best Of, it's here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rtd7ug/ramitheasshole_2021_best_of_nominations/",

Resident bot programmer &lt;a href=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/014/409/phteven.JPG\"&gt;Phteven&lt;/a&gt; here to announce the next AITA Reddit Talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404349195284-What-is-Reddit-Talk-#:%7E:text=Reddit%20Talk%20is%20a%20new,that%20any%20redditor%20can%20join.\"&gt;What is Reddit Talk?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically it&amp;#39;s a live call-in radio type thing where the AITA community can judge each other in real time. What could go wrong? So far, not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve hosted 2 of these sessions so far with tens of thousands of you participating and it&amp;#39;s been a blast. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that said, the next AITA Talk will take place this Thursday, 1/13 at 4PM Eastern, 9PM UTC. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How it works&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Log in to the official Reddit App and join the &lt;a href=\"/r/AmItheAsshole\"&gt;/r/AmItheAsshole&lt;/a&gt; subreddit. You should get a notification when the Talk goes live on Thursday, but if you aren&amp;#39;t notified, check this sticky for a direct link. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This go-round, we will be selecting random people from the community to help judge the Assholes. If you would like to be on the judging committee, once you join the Talk, simply press the little hand icon to &amp;quot;raise your hand&amp;quot; and volunteer. You will be granted permission to speak on the app and can voice your opinion on the asshole in question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the asshole is making their case, everyone listening will be able to vote on whether they think the speaker is the asshole in the situation or not. Once we have heard from the audience volunteers, the Judgment bot will tally the votes and we will render a live verdict. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Want to make your case live?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Please submit your &amp;quot;Am I the Asshole?&amp;quot; stories here: &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrsXlUtC5vI_qFMRbUKC-wXK1gs6RNfOgikPS0heIaynH5-A/viewform?usp=sf_link\"&gt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrsXlUtC5vI_qFMRbUKC-wXK1gs6RNfOgikPS0heIaynH5-A/viewform?usp=sf_link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to share your situation and be judged live, join the Talk on Thursday and raise your hand so we can bring you up to speak. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind we will not be able to select any situations which break the subreddit rules. This includes but is not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Relationship drama&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stories involving violence of any kind&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stories with no interpersonal conflict&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please note that Reddit Talk is an experimental feature created by the Admins of reddit.com and not something we made. We were invited to test it out and while it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun, it is also still in development so there may be some minor technical hiccups. Any complaints about the service or feature requests should be directed to the admins in &lt;a href=\"/r/reddittalk\"&gt;/r/reddittalk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all of you who make this community so fun to participate in. See you Thursday! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for the AITA Best Of, it&amp;#39;s here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rtd7ug/ramitheasshole_2021_best_of_nominations/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rtd7ug/ramitheasshole_2021_best_of_nominations/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My wife does her best to keep up with the cleaning and keeping the house tidy and I feel for her, I really do so I told her she doesn't have to clean up all the time since the kids are running up and down all day and making huge messes, I did tell her that she only has to make sure the house is clean when we have guests over and she agreed with me.\n\n\nWell, the other day I brought over some friends from work and when I opened the door all I could was an utter mess, food and toys and clutter everywhere. I was shocked I was embarrassed and just mortified that my friends saw my home looking like this. Also I have a couple of guys who came over for the first time so the first impression must've been horrible to them.\n\nI took the guests into the least messy part of the house and my friends kept giving me weird looks and making indirect comments about the state of home.\n\n\nI was livid, I waited til they left then went into the bedroom to see that my wife was actually sleeping, I woke her up to ask why she didn't tidy up the house knowing I was going to bring friends over. She said she didn't know but I sent her a text letting her know and she said she didn't see it. I told her it seemed like she did see the text but decided to ignore it? She said no but she wasn't feeling well and had a headache so she thought of getting an hour long nap. I told her that it was so so embarrassing that the house looked like this when my friends came over and that this was avoidable had she cleaned up and prepared the house for the guests. \n\n\nShe argued that first of all, the kids are the ones causing this mess and second of all, it was my fault for not checking twice with her and making sure the house was ready for guests. I thought that was ridiculous because she was basically blaming me for her own actions (or lack of) which I didn't appreciate so much. I told her it was embarrassing and yes she gets part of the blame for the house looking like a complete mess and being out of control like that. She called me a jerk then walked out of the room and avoided speaking to me about it insisting that I'm the one at fault in this sitiation.\n\nAm I?\n\nEdit:- I feel like more relevant context is needed here so 1. The reason I only texted was because this is our usual way of communication so it seemed unusual that she didn't check her phone for any texts.\n\n2 . My kids are under 10 and my oldest is basically glued to her tablet and does nothing to help out.\n\n3 . My wife and I rarely argue about the guests coming over since we would at least have the living room ready any time someone shows up.",

I was excited to be a part of her wedding until I learned more and more. I was pregnant when she asked me to a part of her wedding. Since I have joined 5 people have dropped out due to her attitude and high expectations. Well Katie is upset because of everyone dropping out and the amount of people she has kicked out. She wants everyone to drop everything this year for her wedding. She kicked one personal attendant out for getting engaged. \n\nHere are a few of her expectations: \n1) No one is allowed to get pregnant from here on out \n2) No one is allowed to get engaged as this is \u201cher\u201d year and getting engaged would overshadow her wedding \n3) You must respond quickly and promptly and throughout the entire day\n4) Everything for the bride must be paid for by the bridesmaids on the bachelorette trip.\n5) You must buy new outfits (so that there are no photos of you in them already) for each night of the bachelorette trip (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday), bridal shower (2 days total), and rehearsal dinner PLUS different bridesmaids pajamas for each night of the bachelorette trip\n6) You must have your nails done professionally for each event \n7) You should already order all outfits for each event (wedding is in September) \n8) You must gift the bride at each event as well \n9) Bridesmaids must spend the night for bridal shower and night before the wedding\n\nThe rough estimate for everything she wants (bridal shower, air bnbs, bach trip, food &amp;amp; drink for myself and her, decorations for all events, outfits, etc) was around two grand on the low end. \n\nThere\u2019s so much more and I will add as I think of them at the bottom. \n\nNow, I completely understand this is her wedding and I was totally supportive of her and of all this shit until now. I\u2019m 2 weeks post partum and Katie came to take my baby\u2019s newborn pictures as I had hired her. When she came she insulted my weight multiple times and reminded me I need to lose my baby weight before her wedding (not that much weight?). She then proceeded to insult my infant daughter. She said it was sad she looked like my \u201chillbilly\u201d boyfriend and that her skin tone was reallyyyyyy dark implying it was a bad thing. My boyfriend is half native and when I told her that she backtracked really quickly on her comment. However, she began to make fun of my skin tone because I am a red head and quite pale. She keeps commenting on Facebook posts of my daughter about her looks and even since I\u2019ve blocked her from seeing those posts it still pisses me off. Anyways, my boyfriend thinks I\u2019m overreacting by wanting to drop out and quite frankly never speak to her again.\n\nETA: I know this seems fake but it really isn\u2019t, I\u2019m going to go take a screenshot of one of my many \u201ctasks\u201d off the groupchat on Snapchat and see if I can find y\u2019all some spicy messages[One SS](https://imgur.com/a/7PF4HVt)",

I was excited to be a part of her wedding until I learned more and more. I was pregnant when she asked me to a part of her wedding. Since I have joined 5 people have dropped out due to her attitude and high expectations. Well Katie is upset because of everyone dropping out and the amount of people she has kicked out. She wants everyone to drop everything this year for her wedding. She kicked one personal attendant out for getting engaged. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of her expectations: \n1) No one is allowed to get pregnant from here on out \n2) No one is allowed to get engaged as this is \u201cher\u201d year and getting engaged would overshadow her wedding \n3) You must respond quickly and promptly and throughout the entire day\n4) Everything for the bride must be paid for by the bridesmaids on the bachelorette trip.\n5) You must buy new outfits (so that there are no photos of you in them already) for each night of the bachelorette trip (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday), bridal shower (2 days total), and rehearsal dinner PLUS different bridesmaids pajamas for each night of the bachelorette trip\n6) You must have your nails done professionally for each event \n7) You should already order all outfits for each event (wedding is in September) \n8) You must gift the bride at each event as well \n9) Bridesmaids must spend the night for bridal shower and night before the wedding&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rough estimate for everything she wants (bridal shower, air bnbs, bach trip, food &amp;amp; drink for myself and her, decorations for all events, outfits, etc) was around two grand on the low end. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s so much more and I will add as I think of them at the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I completely understand this is her wedding and I was totally supportive of her and of all this shit until now. I\u2019m 2 weeks post partum and Katie came to take my baby\u2019s newborn pictures as I had hired her. When she came she insulted my weight multiple times and reminded me I need to lose my baby weight before her wedding (not that much weight?). She then proceeded to insult my infant daughter. She said it was sad she looked like my \u201chillbilly\u201d boyfriend and that her skin tone was reallyyyyyy dark implying it was a bad thing. My boyfriend is half native and when I told her that she backtracked really quickly on her comment. However, she began to make fun of my skin tone because I am a red head and quite pale. She keeps commenting on Facebook posts of my daughter about her looks and even since I\u2019ve blocked her from seeing those posts it still pisses me off. Anyways, my boyfriend thinks I\u2019m overreacting by wanting to drop out and quite frankly never speak to her again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA: I know this seems fake but it really isn\u2019t, I\u2019m going to go take a screenshot of one of my many \u201ctasks\u201d off the groupchat on Snapchat and see if I can find y\u2019all some spicy messages&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/7PF4HVt\"&gt;One SS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We are all still friends, but W and I hang out the most because we are the most social people in the group. \n\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way, I am a lesbian, and I am fully out of the closet. W has also never expressed any attraction to me before or after I came out. I\u2019ve always gotten along with his partners, and I\u2019m still close friends with one of his exes. I\u2019m also a very \u201chuggy\u201d person, I give incredible hugs and it\u2019s a skill that needs to be shared and appreciated lol.\n\nHe been dating S (f22) for 2 months now and he seems really happy about it. It had been rough for him during the pandemic, and I\u2019m happy that he found someone who lifts him up. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a little conflicted here.\n\nI was excited to meet S after W talking about her nonstop and we + a couple of other friends met at his place (we are all vaccinated and tested negative). She didn\u2019t seem to like me very much, answering all my questions with one or two word responses and giving my kinda cold looks. I tend to overthink, so I figured she was just shy and I was reading too much into things. We all ended up playing Mario Kart and Smash for a few hours. When it was time to go I hugged W and all my other friends goodbye, I nonverbally offered her a hug but she just shook her head (fair enough, honestly). \n\nThe next day I got a dm from her on Instagram telling me she didn\u2019t appreciate how flirty I was with W and told me to \u201cback the fuck off\u201d. I was pretty shocked, because I thought she knew I was gay, but I could kinda see where she was coming from. I\u2019m very fem presenting so people might often assume incorrectly. I clarified that I am not interested in W or any man for that matter, and I have no intention of getting between them. She said that didn\u2019t matter and I need to \u201cknow my role\u201d. Which was\u2026.interesting. Trying to keep the peace, I told her I\u2019d stop giving him hugs if that was the issue. Which she then replied that she\u2019d prefer I just distance myself from him. I haven\u2019t responded. \n\nI really have no intention of avoiding or distancing myself from one of my best friends. \n\nAITA, is this disrespectful to their relationship?\n\nUpdate: I slept on it and I sent screenshots of the convo to W with the message \u201chey homie, I totally understand if you want to focus on your relationship right now. I don't know if this is a joint decision between you and S, but I will do whatever makes you happiest. If I crossed a boundary please let me know.\u201d he hasn't read the message yet\n\nThank you all for your great advice. You were right, this is his decision to make.",

I would say post-divorce we had a decent relationship and were cordial for our daughter's sake but everything changed they day Jane started dating her current husband \"Tom\" (47m). I guess she needed to prove to him that she was over me by becoming hostile because I for the life of me can't explain what else could be the reason for her becoming so angry and refusing to follow the custody agreement anymore.\n\nBecause of my job at the time she had primary custody but I was supposed to get every other weekend and summers while we alternated Holidays. I had to take my ex to court twice and was just grateful that former-MIL was on my side and wouldn't allow Jane to feed Mandy lies about me. I tried to be patient and forgiving in the beginning but eventually Jane pushed me too far and now I just handle her with cold aloofness and documenting as much as I can when interacting with her.\n\nDuring the pandemic Tom and Jane lost their respective jobs and were in danger of loosing the house. Jane took me to court for more child support which I wasn't going to fight but was mad when she didn't get as much as she wanted. After the decree I started getting suspicious because Jane and I have equal access to Mandy's college fund so I decided to add-in special protections and alerts. I'm the primary on the account and Jane was just an Authorized-Signer.\n\nUnfortunately my suspicions were confirmed and I received a call from the bank about an attempt to take out $10,000. It was Jane, and I was pissed. So pissed that I went to Jane's place and yelled and cursed at her. I knew Mandy was out at the time so I thought I was in the clear but didn't realize when she and my former-MIL pulled up to the driveway. Mandy didn't hear everything but she did learn about what her mom tried to do. Mandy is now upset and acting out and when Jane tries to discipline her Mandy counters that she'll just live with me and loose the child support Jane and Tom desperately need.\n\nJane is now asking me to help her put up a \"united front\" but after what she did I'm not looking into doing her any favors. However, my MIL thinks that by allowing Mandy to play us against each other it will end up hurting her. AITA?",

Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.\n\nI said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.\n\nWhen we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.\n\nI just wanted to spend time with my friends, 1 on 1. AITA?\n\nEDIT: clarification.\n\n1) I mentioned Jane's gender because usually on posts like these, the no partner rule is because the partners are of opposite sex so it's a 'safe space' for the people to talk (guys night or girls night). I brought up that she's a woman because all my friends have male partners but it's still a no-partner's night despite the gender.\n\n2) I am female. Jane is female. I am bi. Jane is lesbian. \n\n3) All my friends are female\n\n4) the party was a birthday celebration which is why it was over 2 days. They usually aren't that long",

It&amp;#39;s incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she&amp;#39;s also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn&amp;#39;t get along with anyone so it&amp;#39;s super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I&amp;#39;m going without her.

She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it&amp;#39;s an issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said I&amp;#39;d leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn&amp;#39;t have it either.

I am not going to defend this anymore to Internet randoms, but please consider researching deaf opinions on the matter. As a hearing person, I can only give a very limited perspective. \n\nHi all. I (30F) am hearing, married to a deaf man (32M) - I\u2019m going to call him Walter - and we have a deaf daughter (6F) - I\u2019ll call her Cora. Walter comes from a primarily deaf family but my family is all hearing. We have chosen to raise Cora with sign language and not go for an implant - this is simply for context, I am NOT seeking judgement on this!\n\nBefore Walter and I got married, my parents began to take classes to learn ASL, as did my brother and his family. My sister, Emily, took them for a bit but ended up not continuing due to \u201clack of interest.\u201d She and her husband have not taken any lessons, nor have their 3 children. Walter tried introducing their daughter to baby sign when she and Cora were both very young but my brother in law asked him to stop, as he didn\u2019t want to \u201cconfuse her.\u201d Cora and her cousins play as best they can with the language barrier but it\u2019s extremely frustrating for her to feel like she isn\u2019t being understood. When my brother\u2019s children (who visit only a few times a year) visit, they interpret for her, or Walter and I have to constantly be looking over their shoulders to help resolve their miscommunications, which is too helicopter parent for me. \n\nWhen we learned Cora was deaf, Emily pestered me about getting her an implant and continues to send me shame-y Facebook posts about the benefits of the implant and those videos of babies hearing for the first time. She constantly says it\u2019s \u201cbetter than having to learn two languages.\u201d She\u2019s been very pushy about it, to the point she and Walter got in a heated argument over it. Since then, she has not pestered him about it, only me.\n\nMy last straw was this past weekend. Emily was with all her kids, teaching them a game. I noticed that Cora wasn\u2019t joining, so I brought her over and Emily outright told me that Cora couldn\u2019t play, because it\u2019s a game \u201cfor people who can speak.\u201d I was fuming and pulled her aside. I told her that my daughter can communicate, just not how Emily wants, and said that I won\u2019t have my daughter excluded for something so petty. I told Emily that we will be cutting contact unless she starts putting in effort - learning ASL, teaching her kids, including Cora, and not being so disrespectful. We got in a spat about it, so my family left. Emily has not had contact since. My parents think I\u2019m being unfair to Emily but agree she should make more of an effort and my brother has completely agreed with me. Walter feels I\u2019ve been extreme but I\u2019m honestly frustrated that I haven\u2019t been this extreme sooner! I do worry that I\u2019m being clouded by Mama Bear rage and this is actually super irrational, so I think I might be TA.

We keep separate financial accounts if that makes a difference, and we alternate who buys groceries week to week.\n\nAnyway\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s the deal - I don\u2019t drink coffee, I drink Mountain Dew or the occasional energy drink for my morning caffeine kick. My husband and the oldest stepson are both coffee drinkers.\n\nWith increasing frequency, I\u2019ll go to grab a drink out of the fridge and all of the soda and energy drinks are gone. The kids have taken to coming home and grabbing two to three or more sodas, and before they left to their mom\u2019s house last week the 15-year-old was actually packing a six pack into his backpack to go.\n\nThe obvious solution (I thought) was to buy *more* soda (yes, I know, it\u2019s awful for the kids but if their Dad isn\u2019t stopping them from sucking down junk food it\u2019s not my deal to intervene). Nope, still gone to where I\u2019d look in the fridge for one, single, much needed energy boost and nada. So I started asking my husband to pick up soda or a few energy drinks on his grocery shopping week to supplement. His response was that he\u2019s not wasting money on garbage like that, and to complain about how expensive things like Mountain Dew are these days. \n\nNext tactic was to ask that if the kids drink the soda that they please leave a few behind if it\u2019s obvious we\u2019re almost out so I have *at least* one or two when I go to grab one. This is where things took a turn for the worse. My husband got irritated that I was \u201cpolicing\u201d the food, and that no one who lives here should have ask permission to eat or drink. Fine, I figured if I wanted to have a Mountain Dew or energy drink to myself then, I would just put a little mini fridge in my office and stash a few in there. I got a tiny fridge that holds a six pack and popped a few in there. I put the cases I buy in my office as well and put a week\u2019s worth in the main fridge at a time so they last until I shop again.\n\nYesterday, the 15-year-old complained that there hadn\u2019t been Mountain Dew in the fridge for a few days and my husband grumpily said \u201cgo get them out of OP\u2019s office, she\u2019s hiding food and snacks from you guys in there.\u201d At this point I put my foot down and said I\u2019m hanging on to some of the drinks that I like every week because otherwise I don\u2019t get any, and if everyone else drank what I put in the fridge for them before I shopped again and my husband didn\u2019t want to buy any himself, that\u2019s just too bad. \n\nMy husband still refuses to buy the soda himself, but is convinced I\u2019m being a complete and total jerk because I\u2019m \u201chiding\u201d what I purchase.\n\nAm I being completely oblivious to my own asshole behavior here, or is this as lopsided as I think it is?",

I haven't seen my family since years and saw them again at the funeral, so everyone said his goodbye and took a look at my brother who laid down in the casket, some cried and some hold their tears back. As I have looked at him, I just felt totally relieved not sad, maybe a little sorry for him. However, the same night I just planned to stay at my parent's house the first time after years again. Some old childhood friend came over to wish their condolences and also my best friend, we got to my old room, and he brought alcohol, and we drank. I am someone who just keeps talking and let out his feelings, while drunk, and so I talked talked. What we didn't knew is that my cousin(15F) has recorded us without our notice and showed everything to my parents.\n\nTo put you guys in the picture, My brother is a Mentally ill person who had the intelligence of a 3-4 year old, he wasn't even able to be vocal about many things. As I was younger, my parents tried to raise me with the only purpose of being his caregiver, and I hated it. They forced to clean my brother as I was 10-11 years old, because \"I had to learn it anyway\". It grossed me out to clean him, change his cloth and change his diapers. I hated him, and my parents. As a 14-year-old, I started to act out and the police had to bring me back home a couple of times, even CPS was involved but nothing happened first. The last time before actions happened, I escaped home for about 2 weeks, before police had found me with the rest of the money I stole from dads pocket, then a therapist talked with me from CPS, and it was clear I couldn't go back home. However, this Monday morning my parents my aunt and cousin waited for me downstairs to confront me, there were a lot of yelling this little goblin recorded me speaking about for 40 minutes. Finally, I burst out and admit, that I feel relieved that my brother died and that it was their fault that I hated him. It just bothers me all the time at the moment and I honestly don't know if I am wrong here, while I feel good about it being out of my system I think it was unfair to kick my grieving parents as they were already suffering. aita?\n\nETA: first of all i am thankfull for all the responses, positive or negative. some people asked detailed in privat and i decide to answer some.\n\n-My Family is a very opressive kind of family and everyone has to obey a certain set of rules, in our Culture children are seen more as posession rather then actual people for themself.\n\n-The final straw for CPS and the therapist was as i admitted to fantasize about harming my brother.\n\n-the only reason why I attendet the funeral was because I thought it would be a closure.\n\n-Since CPS took me from family I lived in a sort of assisten group house with other children who had their Problems with their families(until i reached the age of 18).\n\n-I dont plan to take legal action against the goblin above, its not worth the hadache.\n\n-I created this account to be annonym and dont care if anyone use my post above for his content on any platform.\n\n-I am still in contact with profeasional therapists, and i think i have my life in order.",

What we didn&amp;#39;t knew is that my cousin(15F) has recorded us without our notice and showed everything to my parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To put you guys in the picture, My brother is a Mentally ill person who had the intelligence of a 3-4 year old, he wasn&amp;#39;t even able to be vocal about many things. As I was younger, my parents tried to raise me with the only purpose of being his caregiver, and I hated it. They forced to clean my brother as I was 10-11 years old, because &amp;quot;I had to learn it anyway&amp;quot;. It grossed me out to clean him, change his cloth and change his diapers. I hated him, and my parents. As a 14-year-old, I started to act out and the police had to bring me back home a couple of times, even CPS was involved but nothing happened first. The last time before actions happened, I escaped home for about 2 weeks, before police had found me with the rest of the money I stole from dads pocket, then a therapist talked with me from CPS, and it was clear I couldn&amp;#39;t go back home. However, this Monday morning my parents my aunt and cousin waited for me downstairs to confront me, there were a lot of yelling this little goblin recorded me speaking about for 40 minutes. Finally, I burst out and admit, that I feel relieved that my brother died and that it was their fault that I hated him. It just bothers me all the time at the moment and I honestly don&amp;#39;t know if I am wrong here, while I feel good about it being out of my system I think it was unfair to kick my grieving parents as they were already suffering. aita?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA: first of all i am thankfull for all the responses, positive or negative. some people asked detailed in privat and i decide to answer some.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-My Family is a very opressive kind of family and everyone has to obey a certain set of rules, in our Culture children are seen more as posession rather then actual people for themself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-The final straw for CPS and the therapist was as i admitted to fantasize about harming my brother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-the only reason why I attendet the funeral was because I thought it would be a closure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Since CPS took me from family I lived in a sort of assisten group house with other children who had their Problems with their families(until i reached the age of 18).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I dont plan to take legal action against the goblin above, its not worth the hadache.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I created this account to be annonym and dont care if anyone use my post above for his content on any platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I am still in contact with profeasional therapists, and i think i have my life in order.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Im in my early 30\u2019s so I get it, but it\u2019s getting obnoxious. For the most part I just keep my opinion to myself but my close friends know I\u2019m militantly child-free so my not giving a flying monkey about their babies shouldn\u2019t be a surprise.\n\nAnyways onto the issue, my closest friend got pregnant in the summer and I was devastated.  I kind of thought she was in the same boat as me but obviously not. I\u2019ll admit I reacted a bit poorly when she told me but it was literally months ago. I noticed yesterday we hadn\u2019t talked or hung out in like 4 months (not extremely unusual cuz we both get busy) so I asked her if we could go to a restaurant and catch up. \n\nShe said she was dealing with some major health stuff right now so she isn\u2019t going out at the moment, cool I understand that, so I asked if maybe I could come over for tea or something and she was super dismissive like \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the best time for me for awhile.\u201d So I straight up just asked her if something was up. \n\nShe told me she didn\u2019t really want to hang out right now because she knows I don\u2019t want to hear about any baby stuff. I told her to just talk about other stuff. Like it shouldn\u2019t be that hard. She\u2019s still a person outside of being a spawn incubator right? \n\nWe argued a bit and she pretty much told me she isn\u2019t in the physical or mental headspace to tiptoe around the fact she\u2019s pregnant with me which I literally never asked her to do and she brought up again me mentioning abort**** (mostly jokingly and in reference to me - I was like \u201cOh geez I\u2019d already be at an abort*** clinic\u201d) months ago and said she just couldn\u2019t handle the \u201cnegativity\u201d right now. \n\nI told her she wasn\u2019t doing anyone favours turning into a mommybot and to hit me up when she has a personality again which yeah was maybe a bit harsh but she literally was saying to me we couldn\u2019t hang out because she couldn\u2019t not talk about being pregnant, it seems harsh, but her own words pretty much.\n\nI vented to some of our mutual friends about it and the reactions are split. Some say she\u2019s overreacting and some have talked to her recently and not had it not be about pregnancy anyways so they don\u2019t get her reasoning  and others say I\u2019m a huge asshole because she\u2019s having major complications so it\u2019s probably hard to just \u201cturn off.\u201d Arguably though today was the first I\u2019d heard of any complications so how would I have known?

Im in my early 30\u2019s so I get it, but it\u2019s getting obnoxious. For the most part I just keep my opinion to myself but my close friends know I\u2019m militantly child-free so my not giving a flying monkey about their babies shouldn\u2019t be a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways onto the issue, my closest friend got pregnant in the summer and I was devastated.  I kind of thought she was in the same boat as me but obviously not. I\u2019ll admit I reacted a bit poorly when she told me but it was literally months ago. I noticed yesterday we hadn\u2019t talked or hung out in like 4 months (not extremely unusual cuz we both get busy) so I asked her if we could go to a restaurant and catch up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said she was dealing with some major health stuff right now so she isn\u2019t going out at the moment, cool I understand that, so I asked if maybe I could come over for tea or something and she was super dismissive like \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the best time for me for awhile.\u201d So I straight up just asked her if something was up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She told me she didn\u2019t really want to hang out right now because she knows I don\u2019t want to hear about any baby stuff.

I talked to them and they are going out now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a really great way to start the new year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Like 19 years. Multiple charges. During this time my husband paid for his sisters lawyer. I was on board with this up until he decided to change lawyers half way through, which means we spent almost $9k on two separate lawyers for the same outcome. It sucked but I understood so I didnt make a fuss. Its everything that followed that that has heavily weighed my decision to put all my tax return in a separate account that he cannot touch or have access to. \n\nSo she has been in prison for a year. During this year alone he has spent over $4k just in phone time so his sister can call him, the family and her BF across country (which is $4.50 a minute versus the .30 it costs her to call us). She calls sometimes 3 or 4 days a week and it's always her asking him to spend money and send her things. I'm not sure if any of you are aware how expensive care packages for inmates are but just to break it down- we have to use a specific website (per this prisons rules because all money goes to their funding) and for a small package which consists of 6 ramen noodles, 4 candy bars, 1 pair of socks, 3 instant coffee and a small 8oz dry creamer it costs $84. On top of that she also asks for very specific books that are always $30 or more at least twice a week. I dont even want to calculate how much money he has spent on her considering I know for a fact that last month alone, not including phone time, he spent almost $600 on her. She works in prison and makes her own money that she often gives to her bunk mates because they share everything.\n\nSo I made the decision to make a separate bank account for my tax return. I told him this and said that while I can understand why he is spending so much money on his sister, I will not be changing my future and that I am opening the savings account to put my tax money and my future paychecks in to because I dont want my money going to his sister anymore. At first he said he agreed to this but last night he started talking about us getting a new vehicle with the tax return (we dont need a new car) and I said no, reminded him that I was saving this money and he got angry with me. Saying that we have things we \"need\" and that the only way we could get it was with my tax return (I have kids so I get around $9k back to his $1k because his ex claims his child) but I've stuck to it and said no. I need to safeguard my kids and I cant do that with my money in our joint account due to him spending thousands on his sister. AITA?",

I can remember her telling me how much she hated me and wished I was dead since I was around 9. \n\nShe would refuse to take me out with her and my other (26f) sister when they were teens and I was a child. Since we have an 8 year age gap, i understand why now. Back then, i would cry all the time about being left at home with just my dad. \n\nSince i was often disregarded by my sisters i would play by myself, all the board games like monopoly, clue, dominoes, poker. Anyways, my 26f sister has apologized years ago for how she treated me as a child and i have forgiven her and she has treated me as a sister should with love. \n\nMy other sister 30f, has apologized many times before but never changes. The last time she apologized (I was 14)I told her she truly made me depressed with how she treated me. \n\nWe made up and i thought things would change. I was wrong. \n\nShe continued her behavior towards me including gaslighting me and lying about things she\u2019d done. For example, she\u2019d turn off my data on my phone or kick me off the home wifi so I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything but text on my phone. \n\nI decided because of this behavior that i would cut ties with her. I haven\u2019t spoken to her in years and don\u2019t plan on speaking on with her anytime soon. \n\nHowever, my family constantly gets annoyed with me telling me to grow up and make amends with her because she is after all my sister. I have always said, no I won\u2019t. They claim I\u2019m the AH for putting my parents through the pain of having to see their kids not talk to each other. AITA for refusing to make amends? \n\nBtw, she hasn\u2019t reached out, they all want me to reach out to her.",

          "selftext": "I (26F) have just returned home from attending a close friend's (27,F) wedding. Most of the wedding ceremonies turned out to be a shitshow because my friend turned into a bridezilla. 7 people from the brides party were planning to drop out of the final ceremony because she rejected our outfits at the last minute &amp; wanted us to wear old looking awful outfits that she had got for us. I posted about all of that here but my post got removed because of some issue with my response to the judgment bot. Eventually we decided to attend the wedding to not cause any drama.\n\nOn the day of the reception, i was talking to a couple of people including the groom(34,M), who i dont know very well. We were standing in an area that was away from the main hall &amp; was partially obscured by some decor.He started talking about how i had never hung out with him one on one before, which was weird cus i only knew him as my friends fiance. i laughed it off but he kept going on about it. i steered the convo towards their honeymoon when he said \" bet you wish it was you who was going with me, right\", i didnt reply cus i thought i misheard him. He kept repeating it though and he started saying how if i was his bride he wouldnt be able to control himself rn &amp; that we would have been doing it right here.\n\nI didnt know how to respond so i said WTF &amp; started walking away when he grabbed me arm &amp; said \"lets get out of here, we can be done in 30 mins and no one will miss us\" to which i responded no i will not. He still didnt let go of me &amp; kept saying i know you want to.\n\nOne of my friend Emma had overheard everything &amp; she intervened with her bf at this point. the groom started panicking &amp; said i was too drunk &amp; being inappropriate. My friend knows i havent been drinking at all that day so he got pissed at the groom, all this caught the attention of the bride too, who came over &amp; asked her hubby who repeated the same explanation again. The bride started screaming at me for trying to sabotage her day  so i told her exactly  what her precious husband had said to me with Emma backing up everything. Unbeknownst to us the brides screaming had attracted everyone to the spot &amp; they had heard everything. My back was towards the main hall so i had no idea. i left with some friends right away. \n\nAccording to the brides sister a lot of people believe me &amp; a massive chunk of them left soon after, the bride cried &amp; the groom got drunk. BTW the groom was sober throughout the whole incident. The bride has sent me a lengthy text saying that I should have kept it quiet &amp; talked about it later on &amp; that shes cutting of contact with me as im trying to destroy her marriage. \n\nSome other people in the party have said the same too so idk.

Most of the wedding ceremonies turned out to be a shitshow because my friend turned into a bridezilla. 7 people from the brides party were planning to drop out of the final ceremony because she rejected our outfits at the last minute &amp;amp; wanted us to wear old looking awful outfits that she had got for us. I posted about all of that here but my post got removed because of some issue with my response to the judgment bot. Eventually we decided to attend the wedding to not cause any drama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the day of the reception, i was talking to a couple of people including the groom(34,M), who i dont know very well. We were standing in an area that was away from the main hall &amp;amp; was partially obscured by some decor.He started talking about how i had never hung out with him one on one before, which was weird cus i only knew him as my friends fiance. i laughed it off but he kept going on about it. i steered the convo towards their honeymoon when he said &amp;quot; bet you wish it was you who was going with me, right&amp;quot;, i didnt reply cus i thought i misheard him. He kept repeating it though and he started saying how if i was his bride he wouldnt be able to control himself rn &amp;amp; that we would have been doing it right here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didnt know how to respond so i said WTF &amp;amp; started walking away when he grabbed me arm &amp;amp; said &amp;quot;lets get out of here, we can be done in 30 mins and no one will miss us&amp;quot; to which i responded no i will not. He still didnt let go of me &amp;amp; kept saying i know you want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my friend Emma had overheard everything &amp;amp; she intervened with her bf at this point. the groom started panicking &amp;amp; said i was too drunk &amp;amp; being inappropriate. My friend knows i havent been drinking at all that day so he got pissed at the groom, all this caught the attention of the bride too, who came over &amp;amp; asked her hubby who repeated the same explanation again. The bride started screaming at me for trying to sabotage her day  so i told her exactly  what her precious husband had said to me with Emma backing up everything. Unbeknownst to us the brides screaming had attracted everyone to the spot &amp;amp; they had heard everything. My back was towards the main hall so i had no idea. i left with some friends right away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to the brides sister a lot of people believe me &amp;amp; a massive chunk of them left soon after, the bride cried &amp;amp; the groom got drunk. BTW the groom was sober throughout the whole incident. The bride has sent me a lengthy text saying that I should have kept it quiet &amp;amp; talked about it later on &amp;amp; that shes cutting of contact with me as im trying to destroy her marriage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some other people in the party have said the same too so idk. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We had not much opportunities for an education. For young women in our area, our options were retail, drug dealing, prostitution, or hoping a rich guy would notice us. For guys it was retail, drug dealing, or finding one of the few factory jobs remaining.\n\nI got lucky, managed to date a med student, he helped open doors for me and I have become a teacher in a school in a lower socioeconomic area to provide those oppurutnities. My husband is now a doctor\n\nMy friend tried that option but was not as lucky. She was working min wage retail at age 25. While doing so she got friendly with a factory worker (M30) who came by regularly and they started dating. He knew he was not the academic type, school was not for him. But he also saw potential in my friend and encouraged her to go school. She had dreams of becoming a criminal prosecutor and he encouraged her to not give up. He took out whatever loan he could find so that she could get an education. He supported her through and through, did the house work, worked extra shifts, everything so she could get an education.\n\nMy friend persevered, graduated, and became a lawyer. Shortly after, she broke up with her Boyfriend; just as he planned on proposing to her. She said that as a professional, she had no interest being married to a working class Man and that she \"deserves\" a \"real man\". I was horrified and told her that she is betraying a Man who has supported her through all this and made her what she is. She got mad and said that it is not the Woman's job to pay the bills and that I am a hypocrite cause my husband makes a lot more than me. She further said that the idea of marriage as a life partnership is a patriarchal construct, that she has the right to date whomever she wants, and that as a feminist I should be supporting her. I told her that she is not only a major asshole, she is giving feminists a bad name because feminism means women financially supporting their male partners as much as in the reverse.\n\nEdit: I am no longer friends with her\n\nEdit 2: Yes, he is on the hook for the loans; she has no intent of paying them back\n\nEdit 3: My ex-besties ex-boyfriend has seen this and is thankful for all the support he has gotten. He is still deeply hurt but my husband and I are right now focused on him",

He will make snide comments about vegan food and has even left the cafe a terrible review. \n\nLayla's birthday was last week and she invited our entire friend's group. Her favorite desert is Oreo Cheesecake. I made a large, vegan Oreo Cheesecake along with an vegan appetizer. Her boyfriend had cooked most of the meal and when he tried the desert, he looked like he was about to puke. He looks at me and says Eww, this is absolutely disgusting. I can't believe that you would bring a vegan desert to the party when most of the guests aren't vegan. I apologized and quickly wrapped up my desert and left. \n\nA mutual friend told me that Layla and boyfriend got into a huge fight and she's thinking about breaking up with him. I have received a few horrible messages from the boyfriend and I have since blocked him. A few friends think that I should have brought a non-vegan cake along with the cheesecake. \n\nAITA for bringing a vegan cake to a party?",

That we should lock up our valuables and hope for the best.\n\nI was extremely hesitant but at my wife's insistence, I arranged a meeting at my mother's home and made the offer.\n\nI was immediately told that it was too late and that the new invitations were already sent out and the wedding would be happening at my mother's property.\n\nBut my daughter asked for the 15 thousand dollars I originally offered for an alternative venue to be used to renovate my mother's home a little for the wedding. \n\nI just accepted that this was the best it was going to get and gave her the money.\n\nMy daughter still didn't warm up to me after this and would only reply to texts occasionally.\n\nThen a month before the wedding, I was told to come to the wedding without my wife. My daughter said that similar to how my wife and I felt, her mother and some members of her maternal family felt uncomfortable being around us due to the expired restraining order.\n\nShe said she was willing to fight them to have her father at the wedding. But my wife, stepdaughter and her husband were not invited.\n\nI was incredibly disappointed. I wanted to confront my daughter and potentially not go to the wedding at all if my wife wasn't invited. But my wife said that there's too much bad blood and I should just attend the wedding quietly for my daughter's sake.\n\nI ended up attending the wedding alone and left once dinner was done.\n\nWhile I got to see my daughter get married, my heart feels heavy that it was such a conflict filled situation.\n\nEven having me walking her down the aisle became such a touchy subject  that she just ended up having her half brother walk her down the aisle instead.\n\nWhen I went to congratulate my daughter before I left, she angrily told me that she should've just eloped because of me and my ex. And that it's disgusting that her own parents ruined every aspect of her wedding. That she can't wait to build a life separate from everyone.\n\nI apologized and cried on my way home.\n\nA part of me is happy that my daughter still somewhat talking to me.

First thing I gave my mom a giant hug like my little sister does and said sorry and she forgave me. Then I had a big talk with mom and dad about Elissa. The first thing my mom asked was if Elissa wanted to meet her. She seemed sad when I told her that Elissa threatened to cut me off if I'd ever try to make them meet. Then it got to what I wanted from Elissa and I said I just wanted to be her sister to get to know her and be friends in real life and not just on the phone. I did admit that I wanted to go to pursue the field I told them of at UofTcause of her. I could tell my mom was getting a bit mad but dad pointed out Elissa is really successful a good role model and a good mentor and to deny me her would only hurt my future so I had their permission.\n\nMy mom did bring up the points that you guys did like what if I graduate or get married and stuff. I admitted that I didn't know but I'd find stuff that made it better or find different ways. I guess that hurt my mom so she said it's we'll deal when it happens but that she can work on her pain for me and if Elissa loves me she will too. I did have to promise not to tell my siblings (wasn't going to anyway) about Elissa.\n\nNext time I talked to Elissa I told her that my mom found out we were talking and told her the whole mess that happened. She said she was glad that we could keep talking and it meant a lot to her that I want to be her sister. I told her what my mom said about me getting married and she said they'd find a way and joked that she could just put on a balaclava mask for all events to avoid being seen.\n\nWell on Christmas Elissa FaceTimedd and showed me a really pretty ring her boyfriend got her and said she was getting married and my present was tickets to see her in Spring Break and an invite to her wedding stuff in the summer. She did say if my mom said I couldn't go she'd understand. I talked with mom and dad and I can go as long as I can take my older cousin with me (he's 25 and has known all this for years) and according to Elissa I can. She wants me to have a role in her wedding! Hopefully things aren't bad in march and I can go to Toronto.\n\nHonestly since then its all been great. I talk with Elissa a lot more she's gotten me into a game called Age of Empires, she's helped me with my chemistry homework, mom's been going to therapy about her and started training me in tennis. And on Friday I got the invite card to her wedding and it was written for me as: to my sweet little sister! (have to hide it from my siblings tho)\n\nSo I guess that's me using my one update to tell you guys that I think its a happy ending.",

First thing I gave my mom a giant hug like my little sister does and said sorry and she forgave me. Then I had a big talk with mom and dad about Elissa. The first thing my mom asked was if Elissa wanted to meet her. She seemed sad when I told her that Elissa threatened to cut me off if I&amp;#39;d ever try to make them meet. Then it got to what I wanted from Elissa and I said I just wanted to be her sister to get to know her and be friends in real life and not just on the phone. I did admit that I wanted to go to pursue the field I told them of at UofTcause of her. I could tell my mom was getting a bit mad but dad pointed out Elissa is really successful a good role model and a good mentor and to deny me her would only hurt my future so I had their permission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom did bring up the points that you guys did like what if I graduate or get married and stuff. I admitted that I didn&amp;#39;t know but I&amp;#39;d find stuff that made it better or find different ways. I guess that hurt my mom so she said it&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;ll deal when it happens but that she can work on her pain for me and if Elissa loves me she will too. I did have to promise not to tell my siblings (wasn&amp;#39;t going to anyway) about Elissa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time I talked to Elissa I told her that my mom found out we were talking and told her the whole mess that happened. She said she was glad that we could keep talking and it meant a lot to her that I want to be her sister. I told her what my mom said about me getting married and she said they&amp;#39;d find a way and joked that she could just put on a balaclava mask for all events to avoid being seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well on Christmas Elissa FaceTimedd and showed me a really pretty ring her boyfriend got her and said she was getting married and my present was tickets to see her in Spring Break and an invite to her wedding stuff in the summer. She did say if my mom said I couldn&amp;#39;t go she&amp;#39;d understand. I talked with mom and dad and I can go as long as I can take my older cousin with me (he&amp;#39;s 25 and has known all this for years) and according to Elissa I can. She wants me to have a role in her wedding! Hopefully things aren&amp;#39;t bad in march and I can go to Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly since then its all been great. I talk with Elissa a lot more she&amp;#39;s gotten me into a game called Age of Empires, she&amp;#39;s helped me with my chemistry homework, mom&amp;#39;s been going to therapy about her and started training me in tennis. And on Friday I got the invite card to her wedding and it was written for me as: to my sweet little sister! (have to hide it from my siblings tho)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess that&amp;#39;s me using my one update to tell you guys that I think its a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Nobody really cooks for everyone, we mostly cook for ourselves as me and my brother both work nights, so it's rare we're all together during dinner.\n\nThe problem that's been happening lately (getting worse lately) is that my dad doesn't want to share snacks with me and my brother. He gets really mad at me whenever I grab chips, eat a granola bar, eat any pastries he buys (he'll buy like 12 cinnamon buns and I can't have any), etc. I get not wanting to share snacks, so we came up with a compromise. Any junk food that is on the counter or in the pantry is fair game, and anything in a specific cupboard, in our own rooms, or left labelled in the fridge is off limits. This worked ok for a while, and I started buying my own junk food to keep in my room (honestly I was eating less of \"his\" food than before). Then I started noticing that the food in my room was going missing, I asked if anyone ate it and my dad said he did, because I \"owed\" him. I asked him to stop and he kinda waved it off.\n\nEventually this shifted into him getting upset with me if I didn't buy him anything from the store/any fast food places I went; despite him never asking for anything before I went, only after I got back. It got pretty annoying so I talked to my mom (I did try to talk to my dad but he kept waving me off and saying it wasn't a big deal), and she talked to him and he stopped for awhile.\n\nOnce he started bugging me again about the food, I asked him again what his problem was, because at this point I'm not even eating his food! I rarely even go into the kitchen because I don't want to worry about him popping around a corner watching me to make sure I don't grab any of his food. He got angry and accused me of constantly stealing his stuff, so this was \"payback\" and I \"owed\" him. My dad has always been weirdly protective of his food, but at this point he's getting protective over *my* food. So now he's basically accusing me of not sharing, and yet expecting him to. Pointing out that he has space to put his own food doesn't matter.\n\nToday, he ate the pizza I had sitting in the fridge for my lunch for work. Me and my brother both had pizza in the fridge so I wrote my name on the bag. I saw him eating it right as I went to grab it and head out for my shift. I basically blew up on him, asked why he would do that when *it literally had my name on it* and asked what the point of splitting food was if he just didn't care. Once again, all he said was that I \"owed\" him, and *I should learn to share*. At this point I was pissed and had to go to work so I left.\n\nThe \"owing him\" thing is apparently because he clothed/fed/kept a roof over my head while I was growing up. It should also be mentioned that I do pay rent, and was originally told food was included.\n\nHe thinks I'm an asshole for not buying enough snacks for him, and not buying him fast food whenever I go out.",

But i think it woud be good to get another opionen on this matter, it's a little complicated so please hear me out.\n\nI live in Germany.\n\nMy (M26) Grandpa died a 2 months ago. My Dad inherited every thing which included 3 relativly large properties with houses on them (they belonged to my grandma and her sister which didn't had any children)\n\nMy Mum and my Dad are thankfully in good health, but they planed for the future and wrote their will last week. After that they sat me and my sistster(F24, let's call her Sarah) down and told us how the plan to divide theire belongings in case something happens. \n\nA little background to my sister, she has a longtime boyfriend (M25) let's call him Jim. They've been toegether for about 6-7 years i think. The problem is that both are really bad with money. They switch cars so much that they often take a loss when they are sold again. Only last year the bought 2 cars and made about 10.000 \u20ac minus. I've lend them money on multiple cases sometimes small sometimes large sums. She still owes me around 6.500 \u20ac and she is slowly paying it back, but they are constantly living above their income. Sarah pays for everything.\n\nJim and Sarah are currently living with my parents in a flat and they pay a very small amount of rent.  \nJim wants to build or buy a house in his hometown which is 15 minutes away. Spoiler they can't afford it.\n\nNow the the important part. My Parents want to give most of the inheritance to me. My Sister would only get the flat they are currently living in but i would get the property and the house and all the stuff of my grandparents and she is pissed. Also there is a clause that she can only sell it to me. My parents fear that Sarah will sell everything to sponsor her boyfriends dreams. I also can't kick her out, because she has the right to live there. I wouldn't sell any of the property.\n\nAfter our parents told us that, Sarah later called me and requested from me that she won't need to pay me the 6.500 \u20ac because i'm getting so much more and i should sell the propertys from my dead grandpa and split the money with her and Jim. I told her to fuck off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was 4 days ago and i still don't know what to to. She totally meant it. She blocked me completly and both of them don't want to talk to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit Am I the Asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnglish is not my first language please excuse any typo.",

My dad doesn't care and stays neutral on the matter.\n\nMy mom had made my wife cry on the day of our wedding because she called her the morning of that she should watch out and never hurt me because I'm her baby boy and she won't let any female hurt me. She also told my wife that she must be happy she's taking me away. I told my mom off for her behavior and told her that I won't accept that anymore and if she repeats it I'll go nc. Which I obviously shouldn't say because going nc with family is harder than it sounds. My mom apologised to my wife after the wedding and said she'd try to make it up. I saw my mom genuinely trying but my wife wasn't interested in making up with my mom completely and simply said she'd have a typical relationship to my family out of respect for me and the fact they're my parents and siblings.\n\nFew months after whenever I made plans with my wife my mom, my two brothers and my sister would always complain to me about said plans and tried to get me to cancel them. Those plans would include trying to have a baby, young on vacation, getting a pet and so on. Never heard any of that of course and made my own choices with my wide. My siblings have told me that they start despising my wife and how she has a negative impact from me because she stole me from my family. I texted my siblings in the group chat we have that I want to be left alone and that resulted in my sister and one brother calling me and cursing me out for making mom sad for my wife. My wife heard all of that. She said she doesn't feel comfortable around my family anymore and she wanted to skip all Xmas plans we had with them. I told her we can't do that and that they're my family after all. She finally gave in and came to all our Xmas plans. After every family gathering my wife would be either mad or in tears because of how my siblings and mom would either ignore her or speak to her in a passive aggressive way.\n\nAfter the new years eve party we had with my family we went home and she broke down in tears saying she can't keep doing this anymore and that its my fault for forcing her to come around these people when they treat her like that. This past week we've not talked much because my wife has been going through it but I'm thinking and wondering if I'm really TA here for insisting she spends time with my family?",

          "selftext": "New account. Obvious reason.\n\nMarried w/ 3 Adult kids. All employed and moved out. Six months ago, 24-year-old single Daughter asked to move back home for a year to help save for an apartment. We agreed, and charged her only a small rent (that I planned to give back if she met her savings goals).\n\nThis past summer, wife and I went on a vacation and daughter, without our knowledge, held a party at the house. Upon return, we noted items in the house damaged or missing. Daughter admitted to what happened and committed to pay for damaged/stolen items.\n\nI was upset and felt the privacy and sanctity of 'my castle' was violated. It made me sick to my stomach that strangers I didn't know were in my house and pilfered through my stuff. I got over it and we moved on. However, I made it very clear to my daughter that NO VISITORS were allowed in our house in the future unless we were present and/or approved in advance.\n\nFast Forward to the Holidays. After Christmas, wife and I went on a 3-day getaway.\n\nPrior to leaving, I installed a wireless 'nanny-cam' device in the living room that is hooked up to the internet. I did it on my own without advising my wife and daughter - Kind of like a 'Trust-but-Verify' situation.\n\nAfter a day, I logged into the camera about 9:00 PM and although there wasn't a party going on, my daughter had a guy in the house engaging in an activity I can't unsee. I quickly turned the computer off and told my wife....and then SHTF.\n\nShe accused me of violating my daughter's trust and dignity. She immediately called my daughter and advised that I was 'spying' on her - and our mini-getaway devolved into a series of mean-spirited comments and silent treatment. Upon our return home, daughter was in the process of moving out, and without getting into specifics, I'm apparently the equivalent of pond scum.\n\nIn my defense, what I saw for all of 5 seconds was not expected on my part. Daughter wasn't in a relationship or even dating. Further, she violated my explicit rule of not having guests over....and there was only a single camera that covered the living room - not an area where there is normally an expectation of privacy.\n\nAlthough it's embarrassing all around, I don't think ITA. I believe I was within my rights to protect and surveille my house in the manner that I did. Wife's position is that I had no right to put a camera in the living room without her knowledge, and daughter's position is that if she knew about the camera, she wouldn\u2019t have invited anyone over, but nevertheless believes she did nothing wrong, as she was a rent-paying adult, and was entitled to have a single person over, and what I did was a gross invasion of her privacy.\n\nFor the record...I didn't pass judgment. Daughter is a mature adult and could have engaged in whatever legal activity she chose - Just not in my house involving another person.\n\nSo here I am just over a week later, looking for the opinion of strangers on the internet? AITA?\n\nEDIT - A few comments:\n\n1. Why didn't I tell my wife in advance? I guess I wanted to do an integrity check on my daughter. The summer-time theft incident really shook me, as I had some silver medallions stolen from my desk that had belonged to my father. Very sentimental items. My daughter's take was that 'they were just things'. It really took me an effort to get over it, but I did. I really wanted to know if my Adult Daughter was someone I could implicitly trust.... and my concern was that my wife would tell her about the camera/test.\n2. Some comments were made along the lines of \"What if your daughter walked past naked whilst doing the laundry\"? Honestly, the thought NEVER crossed my mind. We're a family that, for whatever reason, never walked around even half-naked. It just wasn't a thing.\n3. The 'rent' was $200/month all-in, compared to $1,000/month plus utilities and parking that she was paying. A small amount, just on principle, that, as mentioned, I planned to give her back to help with her down payment for a small Condo. Verbal agreement only.\n4. If she had advised that she wanted to invite a single friend over, I wouldn't have had an issue if I'd known the person. My issues were strangers.....as this visitor clearly was.\n\nAs far as what I got out of this exercise?\n\nAbout a 50/50 ruling. Which gives me some comfort in that I'm not some horrible Dr Evil as was suggested in the immediate aftermath.\n\nIf I had a do-over, I would, as some commenters suggested, set the cameras up pointing towards the exterior doors. I would have needed 3, but that would have removed the 'privacy' question from the debate.\n\nI will apologize to my wife and daughter to the extent that, although my motive was pure, my execution could have been refined. However, my daughter and I will still have some work to do on our relationship. She violated my trust.....\n\nAnd....when tempers cool down, I'll suggest that my daughter pay to re-upholstery the sofa.\n\n(I'm kidding.)\n\n(To soon?)\n\nFINAL EDIT - \n\n1. My daughter - whom I still love very much, is currently living with a friend but most of her stuff is still here. It's a tossup what the future holds as far as her living situation. Just as I have softened my position with hindsight, so, I believe, has she. However we still think each other is an AH to some extent - just not as much as one as the moment when the incident occurred.....and we just scheduled a weekend hiking/camping trip with her and her sister, so our relationship will be fine.\n2. Some commenters stated that it was unreasonable she couldn't bring a guest over as a 'rent paying tenant'. That is the hill that I will die on. Her 'rent' hardly even covered the cost of food, and she knew damn well she was likely going to get it back....My wife and I have been very, very generous with our adult children...... After the summertime damages and thefts (which were reported to the police in case the items were pawned), I made it clear that she can have guests, but ONLY if I know who they are in advance, or I am present or agree in advance. NO MORE STRANGERS IN MY HOUSE...(as an aside the party had about 30 people...and some were friends of friends. I was appalled when the full details were finally known...There's lots more to that story!)\n3.  If she wanted a 'Tinder Hook-Up' (I get it, but still...gross), that's what Holiday-Inn Express is for. She has a job and isn't destitute....important to note that she agreed fully at the time, only to argue a different case in the immediate aftermath.\n4. My Wife - Again, with a do-over, I might have been more strategic with my 'discovery' and utilized the info differently, as the SHTF as soon as I told her what I saw. It was very visceral and raw. However, we have a deep bond after 35 years, and have weathered greater storms than this.....at least with all the info out immediately after it happened, there wasn't an opportunity for a bald-faced lie to be made to me, which, in my opinion and based on my personality, would have been much worse all around. \n5. All evidence has been erased and/or destroyed.\n\nI never could have imagined I would have a situation interesting enough to seek outside, anonymous advice from strangers on the internet. Thank you all for taking the time to weigh-in..... except for those that called me a dirty old pervert. Really? That was your take away?\n\nI'm going to share this thread with my wife and daughter so they can understand there is far more gray than black and white. Some of you shared great wisdom that I truly appreciate. \n\nNow, back to being a lurker and judging other people. .... Way more fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Wife&amp;#39;s position is that I had no right to put a camera in the living room without her knowledge, and daughter&amp;#39;s position is that if she knew about the camera, she wouldn\u2019t have invited anyone over, but nevertheless believes she did nothing wrong, as she was a rent-paying adult, and was entitled to have a single person over, and what I did was a gross invasion of her privacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the record...I didn&amp;#39;t pass judgment. Daughter is a mature adult and could have engaged in whatever legal activity she chose - Just not in my house involving another person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here I am just over a week later, looking for the opinion of strangers on the internet? AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT - A few comments:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Why didn&amp;#39;t I tell my wife in advance? I guess I wanted to do an integrity check on my daughter. The summer-time theft incident really shook me, as I had some silver medallions stolen from my desk that had belonged to my father. Very sentimental items. My daughter&amp;#39;s take was that &amp;#39;they were just things&amp;#39;. It really took me an effort to get over it, but I did. I really wanted to know if my Adult Daughter was someone I could implicitly trust.... and my concern was that my wife would tell her about the camera/test.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some comments were made along the lines of &amp;quot;What if your daughter walked past naked whilst doing the laundry&amp;quot;? Honestly, the thought NEVER crossed my mind. We&amp;#39;re a family that, for whatever reason, never walked around even half-naked. It just wasn&amp;#39;t a thing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#39;rent&amp;#39; was $200/month all-in, compared to $1,000/month plus utilities and parking that she was paying. A small amount, just on principle, that, as mentioned, I planned to give her back to help with her down payment for a small Condo. Verbal agreement only.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If she had advised that she wanted to invite a single friend over, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had an issue if I&amp;#39;d known the person. My issues were strangers.....as this visitor clearly was.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as what I got out of this exercise?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a 50/50 ruling. Which gives me some comfort in that I&amp;#39;m not some horrible Dr Evil as was suggested in the immediate aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I had a do-over, I would, as some commenters suggested, set the cameras up pointing towards the exterior doors. I would have needed 3, but that would have removed the &amp;#39;privacy&amp;#39; question from the debate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will apologize to my wife and daughter to the extent that, although my motive was pure, my execution could have been refined. However, my daughter and I will still have some work to do on our relationship. She violated my trust.....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And....when tempers cool down, I&amp;#39;ll suggest that my daughter pay to re-upholstery the sofa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;m kidding.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(To soon?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FINAL EDIT - &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My daughter - whom I still love very much, is currently living with a friend but most of her stuff is still here. It&amp;#39;s a tossup what the future holds as far as her living situation. Just as I have softened my position with hindsight, so, I believe, has she. However we still think each other is an AH to some extent - just not as much as one as the moment when the incident occurred.....and we just scheduled a weekend hiking/camping trip with her and her sister, so our relationship will be fine.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some commenters stated that it was unreasonable she couldn&amp;#39;t bring a guest over as a &amp;#39;rent paying tenant&amp;#39;. That is the hill that I will die on. Her &amp;#39;rent&amp;#39; hardly even covered the cost of food, and she knew damn well she was likely going to get it back....My wife and I have been very, very generous with our adult children...... After the summertime damages and thefts (which were reported to the police in case the items were pawned), I made it clear that she can have guests, but ONLY if I know who they are in advance, or I am present or agree in advance. NO MORE STRANGERS IN MY HOUSE...(as an aside the party had about 30 people...and some were friends of friends. I was appalled when the full details were finally known...There&amp;#39;s lots more to that story!)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; If she wanted a &amp;#39;Tinder Hook-Up&amp;#39; (I get it, but still...gross), that&amp;#39;s what Holiday-Inn Express is for. She has a job and isn&amp;#39;t destitute....important to note that she agreed fully at the time, only to argue a different case in the immediate aftermath.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My Wife - Again, with a do-over, I might have been more strategic with my &amp;#39;discovery&amp;#39; and utilized the info differently, as the SHTF as soon as I told her what I saw. It was very visceral and raw. However, we have a deep bond after 35 years, and have weathered greater storms than this.....at least with all the info out immediately after it happened, there wasn&amp;#39;t an opportunity for a bald-faced lie to be made to me, which, in my opinion and based on my personality, would have been much worse all around. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All evidence has been erased and/or destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never could have imagined I would have a situation interesting enough to seek outside, anonymous advice from strangers on the internet. Thank you all for taking the time to weigh-in..... except for those that called me a dirty old pervert. Really? That was your take away?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to share this thread with my wife and daughter so they can understand there is far more gray than black and white. Some of you shared great wisdom that I truly appreciate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, back to being a lurker and judging other people. .... Way more fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My oldest brother (51) has a mental disorder. He can can eat and care for himself physically but cannot work or refuses to, and cannot be left unsupervised. He was not born this way, but rather developed it in his early 20s. \n\nI was never close to him growing up. I felt he used his condition to his advantage and to gain sympathy from everyone. I had a feeling my dad felt the same way. They used to fight a lot about my brother being lazy and not pulling his fair share even before he developed the condition.  I have always blamed my brother for causing unnecessary stress to my dad while he was battling cancer up to his eventual death. After he died, I got a part time job to help the family, while going to high school. Meanwhile, my brother has never held a job in his life.  \n\nI have made it clear to both my mother and sister that I refuse to be his caretaker when my mom passes. I have offered to provide some help financially, but I do not want him in my house for the rest of his life, or mine. I feel no emotional attachment to him. In fact, dare I say, he feels like a stranger to me.\n\nMy mom almost died last year and spent several months in a rehab facility. During this time, since I was working remote due to COVID, he came to stay with me. My sister rarely helped with him. Even when I had to have surgery, she only took him for one weekend and brought him back. She thinks that because I\u2019m the man and my wife and I have no children, I must assume that responsibility. Anytime I bring it up she says as part of this family, I cannot just walk away from the responsibility as \u201cdespite everything, he is our brother\u201d. My wife was happy to help last year, but did state she would not be ok with this being a permanent arrangement. Frankly, I can\u2019t say I blame her for that. \n\nUltimately, I feel it is my mother\u2019s responsibility to make future arrangements for her son\u2019s well being and not just assume we will handle it. I have sat down with her and offered to pay for legal fees or whatever is needed, as long as she makes the arrangements. Months have gone by, and she just sweeps the topic under the rug. Even if my sister offered to split the caretaking duties and time, I just don\u2019t want any part of it at all. They both think with time I will come around, but I am not.\n\nEDIT: for many asking, he does have a diagnosis of schizophrenia and is on medication. He has had violent stages in the past, but as long as his medication is taken as it should, he is stable.",

          "selftext": " \n\nI (28M) always butted heads with my parents growing up while my brother (26M) always kept his head down and stayed quiet. Because of this, they always favored him. My brother and I never let this favoritism affect our relationship but it made me sour to our parents.\n\nMy brother moved out and eventually got a girlfriend. After dating for two years, they got engaged and moved in together. My parents are Christian and blew up at my brother and his fianc\u00e9 about living together before they were married. For the rest of their engagement, my parents would flip into hysterics about them and made his fianc\u00e9 really uncomfortable. Once they were finally married, my parents calmed down but now my brother and his wife are low contact with them.\n\nBecause of all this, my parents are now treating me like the new favorite despite my distaste for them. Here is where it gets complicated. I met a girl a year ago who I spent all of quarantine with and now we just moved in together. I can confidently say after spending every day together for a year that I plan on spending the rest of my life with her.\n\n\\*Important note, my brothers wife is a mild mannered inoffensive white girl. My girlfriend is Jamaican and combative like myself. My parents are white and have openly discussed their racist views to me and my brother. My mother even told me as a teenager that if I brought a black girl home, she would not be welcome in my mother's house.\\*\n\nNeedless to say, my parents would not approve of my relationship and give me worse hell than they gave my brother if it ever came to light. Here is where I may be the A-hole. I discussed what to do with my girlfriend and initially, I was going to go no contact with my parents. But after a bit of thinking, we realized I was getting gifts, financial help, and some other perks because of my \"favored\" status. So we decided that I would go low contact with them and keep things amiable so I can fly under the radar and milk the situation for the foreseeable future. So far, I was able to have my dad unknowingly gift my girlfriend an immersion blender for Christmas in addition to an electric shaver for myself.\n\nLastly, I asked my brother and his wife his thoughts on this and they agreed it might be a bit of a dick move but well deserved. Of course they agreed to keep our secret and this situation is currently ongoing.\n\nSo AITA?",

Because of this, they always favored him. My brother and I never let this favoritism affect our relationship but it made me sour to our parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother moved out and eventually got a girlfriend. After dating for two years, they got engaged and moved in together. My parents are Christian and blew up at my brother and his fianc\u00e9 about living together before they were married. For the rest of their engagement, my parents would flip into hysterics about them and made his fianc\u00e9 really uncomfortable. Once they were finally married, my parents calmed down but now my brother and his wife are low contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of all this, my parents are now treating me like the new favorite despite my distaste for them. Here is where it gets complicated. I met a girl a year ago who I spent all of quarantine with and now we just moved in together. I can confidently say after spending every day together for a year that I plan on spending the rest of my life with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Important note, my brothers wife is a mild mannered inoffensive white girl. My girlfriend is Jamaican and combative like myself. My parents are white and have openly discussed their racist views to me and my brother. My mother even told me as a teenager that if I brought a black girl home, she would not be welcome in my mother&amp;#39;s house.*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, my parents would not approve of my relationship and give me worse hell than they gave my brother if it ever came to light. Here is where I may be the A-hole. I discussed what to do with my girlfriend and initially, I was going to go no contact with my parents. But after a bit of thinking, we realized I was getting gifts, financial help, and some other perks because of my &amp;quot;favored&amp;quot; status. So we decided that I would go low contact with them and keep things amiable so I can fly under the radar and milk the situation for the foreseeable future. So far, I was able to have my dad unknowingly gift my girlfriend an immersion blender for Christmas in addition to an electric shaver for myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I asked my brother and his wife his thoughts on this and they agreed it might be a bit of a dick move but well deserved. Of course they agreed to keep our secret and this situation is currently ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I got in line, and there was a woman in front of me\u2014well, for about thirty seconds. She left her cart in the line to hold her place and wandered off down the aisle to look for things. The thing is, the line kept moving up, and she still wasn't back. \n\nI tried calling to her from the line to tell her that it was moving up, but she either didn't hear me or didn't think I was talking to her. I wasn't about to get out of line to go over to her, though, because I didn't want to lose my spot after standing there for ten minutes.\n\nSo, after the line moved up three people, I simply walked around her cart and took the next position in line. She finally came back after another minute or two. Instead of asking me to hop back a spot, she kind of just occasionally bumped me with her cart (not hard or anything). When it was my turn to walk up to the register, she tried to zoom around me to get there first. \n\nI still got there first, and she tried telling the pharm tech that I completely cut her in line and that it wasn't fair. I explained that she had been MIA from the line for a good amount of time and had just left her cart there as a placeholder in line. The pharm tech just asked the woman to back up for privacy (and social distancing) reasons. She was huffy but backed off.\n\nWhen I got the prescription and turned to leave, she gave me this death glare like I had killed her firstborn or something.\n\nAITA for moving up a spot in line when someone just wasn't even there\u2014only their cart?",

I got in line, and there was a woman in front of me\u2014well, for about thirty seconds. She left her cart in the line to hold her place and wandered off down the aisle to look for things. The thing is, the line kept moving up, and she still wasn&amp;#39;t back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried calling to her from the line to tell her that it was moving up, but she either didn&amp;#39;t hear me or didn&amp;#39;t think I was talking to her. I wasn&amp;#39;t about to get out of line to go over to her, though, because I didn&amp;#39;t want to lose my spot after standing there for ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, after the line moved up three people, I simply walked around her cart and took the next position in line. She finally came back after another minute or two. Instead of asking me to hop back a spot, she kind of just occasionally bumped me with her cart (not hard or anything). When it was my turn to walk up to the register, she tried to zoom around me to get there first. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still got there first, and she tried telling the pharm tech that I completely cut her in line and that it wasn&amp;#39;t fair. I explained that she had been MIA from the line for a good amount of time and had just left her cart there as a placeholder in line. The pharm tech just asked the woman to back up for privacy (and social distancing) reasons. She was huffy but backed off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got the prescription and turned to leave, she gave me this death glare like I had killed her firstborn or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA for moving up a spot in line when someone just wasn&amp;#39;t even there\u2014only their cart?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We had a lot of them since covid started and none of my profs ever had a problem with how I attended them.\n\nFor context: I run zoom on my desktop computer and I use it with three screens. I do own a tablet for taking notes at school but the camera is broken since it fell off of a table once. We do own an old and broken family laptop but honestly it can't be used anymore.\n\nWe are not allowed to print the exam so we have to view it at a screen. Our camera has to show us and the paper we're writing on. Yesterday my (new) professor told me to turn of my computer since I could use it for cheating and use a laptop instead. I explained the situation to him but he insisted that the computer needs to be turned off. I offered to turn off my other screens or put them away and make the camera show my screens. He wasn't satisfied with it and he started getting louder and even paused the exams for all students. I felt bad for the others so I just did what he said (turn off the computer) and therefore left the zoom meeting. I knew failing would only lower my grade by 1 so I didn't care about that.\n\nHowever the prof called my guardians and told them how disrespectfull I am (I couldn't hear the rest so idk what else he said.) My family screamed at me for being so disrespecting to authority and so on. They took away ALL my devices - even the ones I need for school and work. I'm extremly sad and upset that they are so angry with me. Especially bc I'm usually a well-behaved student so I don't know why that one incident riled them up so much.\n\nSo AITA? Was it wrong from me to leave the meeting just bc I was annoyed and a little embarrassed that the teacher screamed at me infront of the whole class? I honestly feel really bad and regret what I did but I'm not sure if it's just bc they took away my things and I have to use my old phone they don't know I still have. But I wrote an apology email to the school and even some teachers said I only did what he told me to. So what do you all think??",

I got a call from her yesterday asking what vegan options I will have.  I told her none because we already picked the menu out back in July, and we are doing BBQ. \n\nRachel got mad at me and said as the bride and host, it\u2019s my job to make sure she is fed.  I told her she would\u2019ve been fed had sent back the RSVP by the correct date.  Besides, changing anything on the menu, even for a single person, adds a late fee to my caterer because the menu had to be finalized almost two weeks ago.\n\nShe said she won\u2019t come if there are no vegan options but I asked her if it was the other way around, would she serve meat and she said no because it goes against her beliefs.  I asked what she would have me do and she said that if I didn\u2019t like it then I could bring my own food.  So I suggested she do the same and hung up in her face.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 (32m) is with me on this but some people in the bridal party think that since my caterer does offer individual meals (vegan) I should pay the late fee and the additional meal fee so Rachel can eat (total would be almost $120).  They also said I knew she was vegan and should not have needed an RSVP to anticipate Rachel\u2019s needs.\n\nAITA for not doing this?  I would\u2019ve included it had she brought this up before the deadline but she didn\u2019t, and she\u2019s known about my wedding for the entire two years I was engaged.\n\nEdit:  No, she never sent in her RSVP card.  The card had a space for dietary needs/accommodations.",

I told her none because we already picked the menu out back in July, and we are doing BBQ. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rachel got mad at me and said as the bride and host, it\u2019s my job to make sure she is fed.  I told her she would\u2019ve been fed had sent back the RSVP by the correct date.  Besides, changing anything on the menu, even for a single person, adds a late fee to my caterer because the menu had to be finalized almost two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said she won\u2019t come if there are no vegan options but I asked her if it was the other way around, would she serve meat and she said no because it goes against her beliefs.  I asked what she would have me do and she said that if I didn\u2019t like it then I could bring my own food.  So I suggested she do the same and hung up in her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My fianc\u00e9 (32m) is with me on this but some people in the bridal party think that since my caterer does offer individual meals (vegan) I should pay the late fee and the additional meal fee so Rachel can eat (total would be almost $120).  They also said I knew she was vegan and should not have needed an RSVP to anticipate Rachel\u2019s needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA for not doing this?  I would\u2019ve included it had she brought this up before the deadline but she didn\u2019t, and she\u2019s known about my wedding for the entire two years I was engaged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:  No, she never sent in her RSVP card.  The card had a space for dietary needs/accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He goes out and never say where he's going or how long he'll be out, eats at random times during the day, wears earpuds while me and the kids are sitting with him. See, all of these are uncool behaviors and a bad influence on my children. I've already talked to Sean about certain house rules I have and how he was violating them maybe because he didn't but now he knows and still nothing's changed.\n\n\nLast night, he came home late at around 10pm. I wasn't thrilled with that because he knew the rules but he said that he was an adult and I shouldn't be policing him but it's not about that, it's about the fact that he's repeatedly disrespected the homeowner and the rules...So I told him this: \"If he won't respect the rules which are: Being home at 8, not eating at random times, and not using his electronics just like my kids aren't allowed when the family is gathered to spend time together. He ranted about how he wasn't a child, my child and called me unreasonable to treat him this way just because he lives under my roof, I told him it's not hard to show respect really but my wife went off asking what was wrong with me to be giving Sean who's still grieving, ultimatums and treating him like a child. I explained to her that I'm just making sure the kids won't be influenced by her brother's reckless behavior and she laughed asking if I think Sean being on his phone was reckless but that is besides the point. She called me a control freak and told me to get off her brother's back and leave him alone. I replied that she's just saying this because he's her brother but she said I overstepped and should back off and stop trying to control her adult brother. I asked her if she was happy with him coming home late and she said she was sick of arguing then went upstairs.\n\n\nAITA here?",

He goes out and never say where he&amp;#39;s going or how long he&amp;#39;ll be out, eats at random times during the day, wears earpuds while me and the kids are sitting with him. See, all of these are uncool behaviors and a bad influence on my children. I&amp;#39;ve already talked to Sean about certain house rules I have and how he was violating them maybe because he didn&amp;#39;t but now he knows and still nothing&amp;#39;s changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, he came home late at around 10pm. I wasn&amp;#39;t thrilled with that because he knew the rules but he said that he was an adult and I shouldn&amp;#39;t be policing him but it&amp;#39;s not about that, it&amp;#39;s about the fact that he&amp;#39;s repeatedly disrespected the homeowner and the rules...So I told him this: &amp;quot;If he won&amp;#39;t respect the rules which are: Being home at 8, not eating at random times, and not using his electronics just like my kids aren&amp;#39;t allowed when the family is gathered to spend time together. He ranted about how he wasn&amp;#39;t a child, my child and called me unreasonable to treat him this way just because he lives under my roof, I told him it&amp;#39;s not hard to show respect really but my wife went off asking what was wrong with me to be giving Sean who&amp;#39;s still grieving, ultimatums and treating him like a child. I explained to her that I&amp;#39;m just making sure the kids won&amp;#39;t be influenced by her brother&amp;#39;s reckless behavior and she laughed asking if I think Sean being on his phone was reckless but that is besides the point. She called me a control freak and told me to get off her brother&amp;#39;s back and leave him alone. I replied that she&amp;#39;s just saying this because he&amp;#39;s her brother but she said I overstepped and should back off and stop trying to control her adult brother. I asked her if she was happy with him coming home late and she said she was sick of arguing then went upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA here?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My team doesn't do on call for some reason so when this issue happens outside of office hours, on call is supposed to pick it up.   \n\n\nI noticed that on call wasn't always picking up this issue, which mean it ended up causing greater problems which resulted in myself having to deal with it during the following day. So I reached out to the guy in charge of on call and asked if I can be put on the Rota and explained why. He had no issue with it and was also concerned it wasn't being picked up but told me to reach out to the on call team that covers this area.   \n\n\nSo that is what I did, I reached out to them via teams and made a group chat with the guy in charge andI portrayed it as I wanted to join to further development myself and to fully be part of the process rather than just handling the issue doing office hours. However, Billy (false name) said there was no need to have another person and it wouldn't benefit anyone, he came across as rude and defensive.   \n\n\nI did some checking and it turns out he doesn't have the sanctions needed to deal with this particular issue, which seemed very strange to me. I went back and explained a bit more about why I wanted to be on the rota and included that it isn't always being picked up by on call, I then asked how he was dealing with these issues without the correct sanctions. Guy in charge asked me to explain and I provided proof, Billy had no explanation and nothing was said for a day.   \n\n\nGuy in charge contacted me the following day and told me I would be replacing Billy on the rota and asked me to confirm I have all the right sanctions and if anything new comes up with the issues to escalate and get further training.   \n\n\nSo I'm now on the rota and earning an extra \u00a3600 a month. I feel like an asshole as it wasn't my intention to replace Billy but just be an extra person on the rota. Now he is down \u00a3600 a month.",

It started a couple months back when she saw that I was messaging a girl. She never asked about my sexuality and so I thought that was the end of it. I never told her I was gay because I don't know what my sexuality is but I'm content with not labeling myself atm.\n\nAnyways, the issue started after that. Anytime she and I were out together she would tell people (both strangers and old friends) that I'm gay. Any time I talked to a guy at a club, bar, party, etc. she would tell him that I'm gay. We meet up with old friends and she'll somehow manage to force it into the conversation. One time in a bar we met this group of guys who were pretty chill and they invited us to sit with them. They were really friendly and one of the guys and I hit it off talking about books. When I left to get us some drinks I came back and his entire demeanour had changed and he was suddenly very apologetic. He said if he had realised I was gay he wouldn't have come on so strong. I asked him why he thought I was gay and he informed that when I left my friend had sat beside him \"just to let him know\" that I was gay. I immediately pulled her aside and asked her why she thought that it was okay outing me to people when I've never even come out to her and then she switched up and got really defensive, saying it wasn't fair that I was leading that guy on when I wasn't interested, getting his hopes up for no reason, etc. But this was almost every guy I talked to in public she did this with. Even if it was just a friendly conversation she would still tell them.\n\nI was really angry this time and we had a small fight and I called her a lot of names, mostly for assuming my sexuality and for repeatedly outing me to strangers. I mean for all she knew they could have been homophobic and she could have put me in a potential danger as we live in a pretty conversative town. Not to mention that I haven't even come out to my family. She got upset that I called her names (I'll admit I shouldn't have) and called me the AH for lying about my sexuality in the first place and that she was just looking out for me. I never corrected her assumption that I was gay because I always just thought it was easier than having to come out again despite never actually coming out to her in the first place. Coming out is nerve-wracking and I didn't wanna go through it again.\n\nIt's been just over a week and we haven't spoken since I left early that night. I haven't been able to talk to anybody about or get another perspective because I'm still technically in the closet but it's been eating away at me. Did I go too far in confronting her and potentially embarrassing her in front of those guys we were with? I know I should have handled the situation better but the irritation was building for months and I just snapped. AITA in this situation?",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I need a little advice. I (22F) have a friend (23F) who always outs me as gay whenever we&amp;#39;re together. It started a couple months back when she saw that I was messaging a girl. She never asked about my sexuality and so I thought that was the end of it. I never told her I was gay because I don&amp;#39;t know what my sexuality is but I&amp;#39;m content with not labeling myself atm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the issue started after that. Anytime she and I were out together she would tell people (both strangers and old friends) that I&amp;#39;m gay. Any time I talked to a guy at a club, bar, party, etc. she would tell him that I&amp;#39;m gay. We meet up with old friends and she&amp;#39;ll somehow manage to force it into the conversation. One time in a bar we met this group of guys who were pretty chill and they invited us to sit with them. They were really friendly and one of the guys and I hit it off talking about books. When I left to get us some drinks I came back and his entire demeanour had changed and he was suddenly very apologetic. He said if he had realised I was gay he wouldn&amp;#39;t have come on so strong. I asked him why he thought I was gay and he informed that when I left my friend had sat beside him &amp;quot;just to let him know&amp;quot; that I was gay. I immediately pulled her aside and asked her why she thought that it was okay outing me to people when I&amp;#39;ve never even come out to her and then she switched up and got really defensive, saying it wasn&amp;#39;t fair that I was leading that guy on when I wasn&amp;#39;t interested, getting his hopes up for no reason, etc. But this was almost every guy I talked to in public she did this with. Even if it was just a friendly conversation she would still tell them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was really angry this time and we had a small fight and I called her a lot of names, mostly for assuming my sexuality and for repeatedly outing me to strangers. I mean for all she knew they could have been homophobic and she could have put me in a potential danger as we live in a pretty conversative town. Not to mention that I haven&amp;#39;t even come out to my family. She got upset that I called her names (I&amp;#39;ll admit I shouldn&amp;#39;t have) and called me the AH for lying about my sexuality in the first place and that she was just looking out for me. I never corrected her assumption that I was gay because I always just thought it was easier than having to come out again despite never actually coming out to her in the first place. Coming out is nerve-wracking and I didn&amp;#39;t wanna go through it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been just over a week and we haven&amp;#39;t spoken since I left early that night. I haven&amp;#39;t been able to talk to anybody about or get another perspective because I&amp;#39;m still technically in the closet but it&amp;#39;s been eating away at me. Did I go too far in confronting her and potentially embarrassing her in front of those guys we were with? I know I should have handled the situation better but the irritation was building for months and I just snapped. AITA in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

She says she's waited ten years for this and does not want to spend it playing nursemaid, and then advocated daughter #2 take time off from both her jobs to fly down here at MY expense and provide the care. I'm retired, have limited excess funds, and would not be able to compensate D2 sufficient for her financial obligations. \nAdditionally, I am paid to care for her children, and if surgery is done during her sabbatical, I would not be losing any income as she wasn't going to pay me anyway. If I wait until summer, then I lose that income for a month, plus potentially have to pay for daughter #2 to come down IF she could get the time off.\nI've taken time to be there for her for 3 births and 3 surgeries. AITA for having surgery during her long-awaited sabbatical?\nEdited to add she gets six weeks paid sabbatical in addition to 5-6 weeks paid vacation--although she'll only get 4 with the sabbatical.",
