My situation was is more common than you would think and I would encourage everyone to read the book \"Bullshit Jobs\" by David Graeber.\n\nBefore the pandemic I worked as a tech lead for a fortune 500 company, I won't say which one but they make a product that everyone consumes. In theory I was supposed to be mediating the relationship with vendors (who do the actual work) and coming up with independent estimates to keep their estimates in check.\n\nThe first few weeks start out slow and onboarding takes forever. I can't get access to tools that are essential to my job so I have to keep going back and forth and escalating until they give me access to everything, including things I had no business using. The project starts and I'm working with a project manager, a product manager, myself, my manager and one software engineer working on it. That's a 4:1 ratio of managers to people doing actual work and our daily meetings consist of this one person talking about the work they did and the rest of us asking questions. I point out the absurdity of this situation and I'm assured that more developers will be added to the project shortly.\n\nEventually we do get more developers along with the news that the project in its current form is no longer viable. Does this mean that I (along with the other managers) will be laid off? No of course not, they invested a lot of energy putting this team together and they signed contracts with the vendor so the project continues and the outcome is irrelevant. We continue our daily standups with the software developers who have no idea that their work will not be used. I have no work to do, but I need to keep showing up to work. Every once in a while I point out the absurdity of this situation to my higher ups. I proclaim that the company is wasting millions of dollars and one of the senior executives proclaims they'll lose tens of millions if they need to. That's the moment I realized I'm not cut out for upper management at a large company.\n\nAfter a few months I'm put on another project with a similar structure. This project is a collaboration between two C level departments that each want the other department to fail. I had one vice president tell me that whatever I do I should not talk to this other vice president because she will find something to use against my department. Sure enough that other vice president does exactly that and regularly calls me (including during off hours) to try and get information she can use to make my boss look bad. I quickly realized that the whole point of my job was to not make my boss look bad in meetings and emails. It didn't matter if I worked 40 hours or if I worked 4 hours.\n\nThe irony is that everyone was aware of the absurdity of this situation and the executives weren't stupid. I had a good relationship with my boss's boss and I confided in him that I wasn't doing much. He told me that he knew and it didn't matter because he was leaving soon anyway. After a year of working \\~4 hours a week I felt like my skills were atrophying so I decided to find another job and call it quits. When I gave my notice my new boss told me that I was doing a great job, he wanted to keep me, and **they were willing to bump my pay to 300K**. I was shocked because there was no way I was worth that much and I didn't have faith in the company so I wound up leaving.\n\nThe truth is it's degrading to be paid a lot of money to do nothing. Not nearly as degrading as the other posts on this sub about wags theft or being asked to come in during off days. The more I read your posts about getting paid nothing and being asked to work extra the more it makes me angry about the situation I found myself in where I was being paid to do nothing. Not only are the working class propping up the fortunes the ultra rich, but they're also allowing their lackeys to employ cadres of white collar workers that don't actually do anything.\n\nI thought my situation was unique until I read \"Bullshit Jobs\" by David Graeber.

[Since then it hasn\u2019t even kept up with inflation](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/01/21/if-worker-pay-had-kept-pace-productivity-gains-1968-todays-minimum-wage-would-be-24). Minimum wage needs to increase automatically and independently of federal budget politics to keep pace with inflation and productivity. \n* **Minimum wage needs to increase immediately.** No more 5, 10, 15 year plans. Wages are a business expense, and if businesses can\u2019t afford it they need to take out a loan instead of making workers subsidize their business by working for free. Every dollar less than $24/hour is free labor that you are forced to give your employer. \n* **No more exceptions.** Farm workers deserve a living wage and the [same rights to overtime](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/whdfs12.pdf). Folks on SSI deserve a living wage and the [right to a savings account](https://scholarship.law.slu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1272&amp;context=jhlp).

They don&amp;#39;t pay for membership because it&amp;#39;s included in their rent. The guy who is still my boss at this moment owns the whole building. So he&amp;#39;s technically a property owner/developer, not really a gym owner. I&amp;#39;m the only trainer here and I run the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "content": "I work in middle management of a Bulgarian IT company. Previously I was an engineer for many years.\n\nThe company boasts having only one round of interview but the reason they are doing that is so that the competition doesn't snatch people.\n\nAs you can imagine, IT professionals, particularly seniors, are highly prized, and the companies cannot even hide the fact anymore.\n\nHowever, there is still a stigma about sharing salary info and that is because they are STILL trying to undercut people. I have already talked to management about this and explained to them that they WILL get what they pay for, because programmers are not dumb and they will find the best compensation package either way.\n\nSo, back to what happened yesterday:\n\nA guy comes to the zoom interview, introduces himself, the projects he has worked on, what he would like to work at AND he caps it off with\"and I am not going through the trouble of joining the company for less than X euros\".\n\nHR: \"Well, that's not something...\"\n\nme: \"Ye you can have that as a senior engineer\"\n\nSlack starts BURNING as both the recruiter and some HR people start telling me I was way out of my line. This is all happening while the interview is still on, btw, they couldn't fucking wait.\n\nIn the middle of the interview I see a meeting scheduled with the HR leader.\n\nIt turns out the guy is rather clever, very skilled and definitely a senior engineer. The money he asked for was even within company bands for the position (and the range for senior engineers is really wide because they ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ON THE MARKET, would you imagine that?).\n\nBut the thing that made me chuckle really hard was that in the English portion of the interview (which we do to gauge people's English) I asked him: \"Do you like work in general, or would you say you are against it?\" to which he replied \"I am very much anti work, I prefer spending time with my family\"\n\nThe reason this didn't tip HR off is because we actually do have a HR section of questions with dumb questions like this, so asking something like this would only be mildly unusual but the reason I asked is because I wanted to figure out if it is someone from this sub. That is INCREDIBLE because this sub has 1.6m people and I find it insane that I got to meet someone that is not from the US.\n\nBut how did my HR talk go, you might ask?\n\nWell, about as \"well\" as you'd expect.\n\nI was told:\n\n1. I am way out of my line for telling a guy he can expect a certain salary and it is up to the upper management to decide this, not me\n2. I need to follow procedures if I want to show I keep company's interests in mind\n3. I have removed any negotiating power from the company by telling the guy he can expect that salary\n\nAnd I told the HR leader:\n\n1. The guy decided his own salary when he dropped the number in the interview, the company could not do jack shit at that point as he is probably interviewing with 10 other companies as we speak and he would just drop the interview with a 'no' and the company is quite frankly desperate\n2. I thought company's interests were related to employing the top talent for best compensation (and I reminded the HR person it says that on one of the fucking brochures for the company)\n3. You never HAD any negotiating power, the only thing you could do is tell the guy a number that is way too low and he'd ghost you.\n\nThe funniest thing about the whole ordeal is that in IT, and especially in countries like Bulgaria, there is an insane demand for senior engineers, there is not a single person in the industry that can reasonably believe that companies have the upper hand. Realistically, it is always senior engineers that dictate the pay, and I think it was this sub that encouraged the guy to just ask for money (though maybe he could have asked how much the company is willing to pay so he could ask even more, but he probably knew he would not get an actual number).\n\nI have another meeting scheduled today, with the company's leadership, about 'my performance'.\n\nI am generally well paid but I can also find the same or better job elsewhere, in case I am fired for pretty much cutting bullshit. The thing is, they can't fire me because they can't find people to replace me, so I suspect they will have to dial criticism back a few notches and try to 'kindly' explain to me not to do this again, while hoping they can get rid of the problem dog at some point in the future.\n\nUPDATE: Surprise, I didn't get fired, but I got some super specific and noninflammatory advice from the upper management. I also asked them if I get the bonus for pulling in a senior dev successfully to which they laughed but I also tried explaining to them that if we tried to weasel out of his question, he'd just leave the zoom meeting. I got the comment that it would mean he is not 'fit' and I said that setting yourself up for exploitation is not about fitting a company and they know it well, I just got a few shrugs for this and no further replies. I am sure I'll see something matching my job description on the Careers page soon :')",

    "content": "As promised here is an update on what happened with my wife. For those that didn\u2019t see the first post, my wife works for my uncle and dad as an office manager. She did payroll, the accounting, she scheduled jobs, conducted all the interviews and balanced the books. If something needed to be done in the office it was probably her responsibility and she makes 21 an hour in one of the most expensive counties in California. Her working 40 hours a week every week doesn\u2019t even pay our rent. My Dad is a nice guy but my uncle is a huge POS and very abusive towards his employees. I recently learned that their employees usually have a two month turn around, in that new employees only last a few weeks or months before getting the hell out of there. The Christmas party last year was the final straw for my wife, she was embarrassed by her boss in front of everyone she works with, even after she spent hours of her own time setting up that party. After the party we went to San Diego for a few weeks to visit her family and she told me she wanted to quit and I was and still am very supportive of that decision. She told him at the Christmas party that she wasn\u2019t coming back but he didn\u2019t seem to take it seriously, she called back on the first to give him an ultimatum. \n\nShe told him that she wanted 40 an hour for doing the work of 3 people and he literally laughed out loud at the thought of 40 an hour. She also demanded other benefits like PTO and healthcare (most others in the business have healthcare included in their contract). She knew he would say no, which he did, and so on the 1st she officially quit her job! I talked with my uncle several times over the last few months, all of which turned to screaming arguments just short of physical fights. A few days ago my uncle made the realization that not paying my wife 40 an hour meant he would need to hire 2 or three untrained workers at 20+ an hour to keep up with the work. My wife is sad because there was businesses they worked with that my wife was friends with and I know she is going to miss some of the clients. \n\nMy uncles business just took a major hit because he couldn\u2019t pay a reasonable wage for a skilled employee who took care of things without him even knowing. She was like the glue like kept the whole thing together. It may not seem obvious to him now but when people stop doing business because my wife isn\u2019t there he will be devastated. Fuck that guy.\n\nEdit: There\u2019s a lot of comments and I\u2019m terrible at replying so I\u2019ll provide a few general updates. \n\nA lot of people had the same idea we did, contact other clients of hers. We actually did do that! Last week she called a few of the sub contractors they use and got a offered a few interviews, but once we sat down and really talked about it, moving seemed the best option. Her family lives nearly 10 hours away and with a one year old we could move near them, not pay for child care, and live off my income alone. My wife will probably want to work, that\u2019s her choice I\u2019m fine with it either way. We have talked about it before but 100 percent decided we\u2019re just gonna move and live off my income for awhile. \n\nMy Uncle is in fact a huge POS, just another reason to move but I\u2019ll give it a few weeks before he calls and makes a big offer to get her back, that\u2019s the kind of guy he is. She gained some really great experience by working there and thankfully she can use that experience else where at a better paying job that respects her.",

Titles that &amp;quot;piggy back&amp;quot; off of other posts, like &amp;quot;Since we&amp;#39;re posting Mcdonalds....&amp;quot; will also get you banned. You also shouldn&amp;#39;t include where you&amp;#39;re cross posting it from, just throw a source link in the comments. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t need unnecessary information in the title, just describe what you&amp;#39;re posting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Breaking this rule will get you a temp ban in most cases (combined with other broken rules, or multiple offenses will mean a longer temp ban or permanent ban).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If needed provide a source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t completely explain why the content of the post is IAF please comment with more explanation. If your post claims something that most everyone can&amp;#39;t easily confirm from reading your title and viewing your content please provide some type of proof of what you claim. Do not claim ownership or creation of something you did not create. Do not post false or misleading information&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Note: Breaking this rules will get you perma banned in most cases. *&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t spam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty self explanatory, don&amp;#39;t post spam, don&amp;#39;t spam the subreddit with many links. If you&amp;#39;re solely posting to promote yourself/sell something you will be banned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Breaking this rule will get you permabanned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No gossip or tabloid type material&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t the place for celebrity news, or general &amp;quot;TIL&amp;quot; type posts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Breaking this rule will get you temp banned in most cases (combined with other broken rules, or multiple offenses will mean a longer temp ban or permanent ban.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;No text on images/gifs/videos&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In most cases text on an image is useless. It can be put into the title or into the comment section. Text on gifs is sometimes useful, but still preferred to put information into the title and/or into the comment section. This also encourages discussion. There are some exceptions to this rule, mainly dates or little labeling on images/gifs/videos. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Breaking this rule will get you temp banned (combined with other broken rules, or multiple offenses will mean a longer temp ban or permanent ban.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Civil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s perfectly fine to disagree with anyone about most things, but there is no need to insult the person. Debate/discussion/talk about the idea/content, not the person. If someone is arguging in bad faith, concern trolling, baiting, general trolling, or just being a rude individual REPORT THEM, DO NOT ENGAGE with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Breaking this rule will get you at minimum temp banned, the more offenses/worse they are means the longer the ban (combined with other broken rules, or multiple offenses will mean a longer temp ban or permanent ban.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other things to note:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sub filters new users in order to remove spam. If you are a new reddit user, please gain some karma and wait before posting. This is to prevent spam and new users who don&amp;#39;t understand reddit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "title": "Some Clarifications About Abortion-Centric Debates",
    "content": "Hey there, folks.\n\nThe political climate in many countries has been shifting as of late, and as a result, quite a few people have voiced concerns about what the future might bring. While these worries are completely understandable, they\u2019ve recently resulted in some unacceptably hostile debates in /r/Pics.\n\nSpecifically, the subject of abortion has proven to be a divisive one. Many people have stated that anti-choice perspectives are inherently misogynistic, and there\u2019s significant merit to that claim.

While these worries are completely understandable, they\u2019ve recently resulted in some unacceptably hostile debates in &lt;a href=\"/r/Pics\"&gt;/r/Pics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the subject of abortion has proven to be a divisive one. Many people have stated that anti-choice perspectives are inherently misogynistic, and there\u2019s significant merit to that claim.

So you can just drop the E as he hits full grit if he&amp;#39;s being focused and he literally can&amp;#39;t do anything lol.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ekko being a menace? Is he jumping on your teammates and just wildly pelvic thrusting their faces into oblivion and then trying to press R? Literally just drop E on him and his love interest. Suddenly, he can&amp;#39;t press R.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kat is doing some insane reset madness jumping around and flipping knives out of her fucking tits? E.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Samira nonsense? E. Kayn just Q&amp;#39;d in? E. Diana? E.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its really that Easy. But I never see Soraka. Even when something like Ekko becomes wildly popular, even though she very blatantly just out right  hard counters his entire gameplan of jumping into your team and pressing R to get out lol.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do people just not like Soraka? Even though she holds the keys to stopping the things people hate?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "content": "Now that there's been enough time to process everything that happened in Endwalker, I'd like to return to one of my favorite pastimes: baseless speculation. We are at a wonderful point in time right now before the 6.X patch content info dump, a liminal space without any of those pesky facts to get in our way. In this post, I will channel the ambient aether around me and accurately predict what will happen over the next ten years of story in FFXIV. Man, I'm gonna look so smart. \n\n#### Patch 7.0:\n\nAfter a bit of 6.X patch content where we grapple with the impossible task of rebuilding Garlemald in a way that doesn't make everybody super fucking angry, we're obviously going to go explore Meracydia with Fordola and Estinien. Also G'raha is there. Fordola's story themes will echo that of Tiamat: trying to figure out how to move forward in life and deal with the guilt and grief surrounding all the terrible things they did in the past. Just like Fordola will never find peace in Ala Mhigo after killing so many of her kin, Tiamat will not be able to find peace after summoning the primal Bahamut which destroying the society she used to love. Both of them find themselves without a home, and then find themselves wrapped up in Estinien's quest to find Azdaja in the New World. After solving the mystery of Azdaja's silence up til now, we have an epic finale where we help her protect the World Tree from a dire threat of some kind and find a new home for them both. \n\nAlso some of the 6.X patch content will be about helping Y'shtola find a way to travel to the shards, which leads us to...\n\n#### Patch 8.0:\n\nAfter a bit of 7.X patch content where we successfully make it back to the First and catch up with everyone, obviously the next thing we would do is travel to the 13th with Y'shtola and Unukalhai to try and restore it. Also G'raha is there. We learn more about Diabolos and Zenos' reaper partner, how both of them were important figures in the 13th's late history just before it was overtaken by astral darkness. Neither of them are the Big Bad of the expansion, but are complicated characters with understandable motivations that are at odds with ours. We learn that the 13th isn't just a desolate wasteland like the Empty, but there's actually a lot going on as we get embroiled in all of the politics. The epic finale is a symbolic battle of ideals, pitting excess and hedonism against hope and empathy. Somehow the World Tree is an important plot element that helps us succeed in rebalancing the aether. \n\nAlso some of the 6.X and 7.X patch content is about helping the Loporrits and the Omicrons work together to rebuild the bar at the edge of the universe, transporting some displaced people on Etheirys to find a home on the moon, and learning more from the first brood about the history of the dragons, which leads us to... \n\n#### Patch 9.0: \n\nAfter a bit of 8.X patch content where we help both the 1st and 13th shards reclaim their newly habitable wastelands, bringing the Night's Blessed to the 13th along the way, obviously the next thing to do is travel to the Dragonstar with Estinien and the Loporrits to try and see if there are any eternal dragon souls wasting away that we can save. Also G'raha is there. We do indeed find some, as well as the decaying (but still alive) remnants of Omicron civilization. We use all our wisdom and experience gained up until this point to broker some cooperation between the two with the goal of rebuilding life throughout the universe. Everything we have learned about World Trees and from restoring the 13th makes this possible, and it turns out every star has their own Big Important Tree. The epic finale is um, us finally getting to kiss G'raha? I don't know, man, I'm running out of steam. This shit's gonna involve some brand new plot stuff that hasn't been introduced in the game yet. \n\nThis then brings us to...\n\n#### Patch 10.0: \n\nOk I'm out of ideas. Maybe what I said for 9.0 is actually 10.0, and in between some of my predictions we end up going to some of the other shards we know nothing about to make contact with them or something. But I'm pretty sure Y'shtola's gonna not have any more death fake-outs, but the writers *will* make fun of us for thinking there will be. By actually killing her for real. Also G'raha is there, he fucking better be. \n\nTL;DR: Everything I said will turn out to be wrong and you can skip this post.",

You're not going to be scared by it, but you may like being swaddled in something as cozily familiar as Freddy Krueger's sweater. **B-** \\- Joshua Rothkopf, *Entertainment Weekly*\n\nFor the most part, this is a 're-quel' as fast, funny and ferocious as a Scream movie should be. In an era of elevated horror, it's a gloriously gory basement party. **4/5** \\- Ben Travis, *Empire Magazine*\n\nA slick, self-satisfied giggle of a movie. **B-** \\- Katie Rife, *AV Club*\n\nThis latest spree is openly modelled - set-piece by set-piece - on the first Scream, even as it constantly negotiates its own delicate status as a 'requel' in a shifting horror landscape. - Anton Bitel, *Little White Lies*\n\nThe new movie successfully continues the Scream tradition of evolving via sharp, fresh commentary on the horror genre, but one of the fifth installment's most striking qualities is that it is absolutely oozing with love and respect for this franchise. **4.5/5** \\- Perri Nemiroff, *Perri Nemiroff (YouTube)*\n\n**Plot**\n\nTwenty-five years after a streak of brutal murders shocked the quiet town of Woodsboro, a new killer has donned the Ghostface mask and begins targeting a group of teenagers to resurrect secrets from the town\u2019s deadly past.\n\n**Directed by**\n\nMatt Bettinelli-Olpin &amp; Tyler Gillett\n\n**Written by**\n\nJames Vanderbilt &amp; Guy Busick\n\n**Based On Characters Created by**\n\nKevin Williamson\n\n**Starring**\n\n* Melissa Barrera as Sam Carpenter\n* Sonia Ben Ammar as Liv McKenzie\n* Kyle Gallner as Vince Schneider\n* Mason Gooding as Chad Meeks-Martin\n* Mikey Madison as Amber Freeman\n* Dylan Minnette as Wes Hicks\n* Jenna Ortega as Tara Carpenter\n* Jack Quaid as Richie Kirsch\n* Jasmin Savoy Brown as Mindy Meeks-Martin\n* Marley Shelton as Judy Hicks\n* Roger L.

    "title": "I rewatched the Scream franchise and recorded every instance of screaming. Scream (1996) features the least amount of screaming (37) and it made the most money and has the highest averaged critical/audience scores. Scream 3 features the most screaming (58), and it has the lowest scores.",
    "content": "Quick note - This data is meant to be cheeky. \n\nThis morning, I woke up with this feeling, I didn't know how to deal with, and so I just decided to myself that I\u2019d count all the screams featured in the *Scream* franchise to see if there's an ideal amount of screams, or whether they affect the Tomatometer/IMDb/Metacritic/Box Office results.\n\nAfter some research, I found that there are a few [infographics](http://www.mtv.com/news/2803823/scream-iconographic/), lists and videos that attempted to count the screams, but they didn\u2019t seem thorough enough to stop me from my quest. Thus, I felt like my idea to count the screams was justified (Hello Mickey from *Scream 2*). To prove I did the work, I\u2019ve provided timestamps of all the screams I included in my count. \n\nHere\u2019s what I counted as a scream:\n\n**Scream** \\- When a character belts out an \"aaaaaaahhhh\" or \"eeeeeeeee\" (you know the noise). I didn't count when a character yells 'Help me!\" or \"Oh, sh\\*\\*!\" No words, only primal screams.\n\nI counted screams that occured during these instances:\n\n1. When a character is being chased or killed\n2. When a character screams in reaction to seeing someone being chased or killed \n3. When there's a cheeky jump scare and people scream (think *Scream 3*)\n4. I didn\u2019t include the screams featured in the *Stab* movie that played in *Scream 2*\n\n**Amount of screams per film**\n\n1. Scream (1996) - 37\n2. Scream 2 (1997) - 51 \n3.

Thus, I felt like my idea to count the screams was justified (Hello Mickey from &lt;em&gt;Scream 2&lt;/em&gt;). To prove I did the work, I\u2019ve provided timestamps of all the screams I included in my count. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s what I counted as a scream:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scream&lt;/strong&gt; - When a character belts out an &amp;quot;aaaaaaahhhh&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;eeeeeeeee&amp;quot; (you know the noise). I didn&amp;#39;t count when a character yells &amp;#39;Help me!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Oh, sh**!&amp;quot; No words, only primal screams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I counted screams that occured during these instances:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When a character is being chased or killed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When a character screams in reaction to seeing someone being chased or killed &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When there&amp;#39;s a cheeky jump scare and people scream (think &lt;em&gt;Scream 3&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I didn\u2019t include the screams featured in the &lt;em&gt;Stab&lt;/em&gt; movie that played in &lt;em&gt;Scream 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amount of screams per film&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scream (1996) - 37&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scream 2 (1997) - 51 &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scream 3 (2001) - 58&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scream 4 (2011) - 43&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Total - 189&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scream&lt;/strong&gt; (1996)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tomatometer - 79% &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;RT Audience Score - 79% &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IMDb - 7.3&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Metacritic  - 65%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Average of all four - 74 (the 7.3 IMDb score became 73)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Worldwide box office - $175 million&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How many people are killed by Ghostface(s) - 5&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; features the least amount of screams and death.

It's a shame that some saw it as a Sixth Sense rip-off when it first came out simply because it involved &gt;!a little kid character that saw ghosts!&lt;, it was a completely different type of story altogether. \n\nReally loved the twists &amp; turns in the film, I honestly didn't see them coming at all. Nice eerie atmosphere throughout the film. I loved the cast of actors in this film as well. Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Kevin Dunn, Jennifer Morrison, Illenna Douglas, Eddie Bo Smith Jr., Liza Weil etc. I thought that cast were likable, they all felt like close friends in the neighborhood &amp; you feel for them when weird things start to happen. The DVD's menus are pretty creepy too lol, I had a friend that was pretty terrified of the film from the main menus alone, she had never heard of the film but when she saw the menu screen, she was creeped out immediately. It scared her but she still enjoyed the film, said that the menus added to the atmosphere &amp; creep factor. \n\nI always felt that Kevin Bacon was really good in this film &amp; wished that we got a sequel with the cast returning, I think it could've been good, shame that we never got it. It doesn't get talked about much but it's still a great horror flick with a nice soundtrack. What did you think of Stir of Echoes &amp; the performances in it? Did the twists catch you offguard? Did it scare you? For those that have the DVD, did the menu screens creep you out? I won't lie, they're pretty damn creepy. Also, how do you compare it to the novel from Richard Matheson?

    "title": "The 885 Movies I saw in 2021",
    "content": "Inspired by [u/ PopeDarthPaul's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/koa5ky/i_watched_749_movies_in_2020_including_636/) ,  I decided a year ago to start reviewing the many films I watch. Bit by bit, writing these short reviews became my main creative project for 2021.\n\nThe combination of being retired, and alone, plus Corona, enabled me to happily watch an average of nearly 3 films per day, and reverted me to the old days 40 years ago, when I studied Film at the University of Copenhagen under Peter Schepelern, and learned about semiotics, history &amp; film theories.\n\nI enjoyed this year tremendously, and intend to continue spending (\u201cwasting\u201d) my time exploring old and new films alike.\n\nBelow are some statistics and a short list of a few curious finds.\n\nI called my project \u201c1,000 films\u201d but ended up seeing a total of 'only' 885. Out of these, 122 were documentaries, 41 Shorts and 10 were stand-ups. I watch all these films on the free streamer \u201cCataz\u201d, which contains 90% of every film I ever wanted to see.\n\nI thought of myself as an an all-round cineast, versed in world cinema,  interested to discover rare gems old and new. But sadly, after looking at my end-year summery, I realized that this was not the case and I am far from a completist: Only 302 were \u201cforeign films\u201d and at least 198 (22%, and usually of my best-rated films) were films I had seen before, sometimes more than 2-3 times.\n\nOf the \u201cforeign\u201d films, 64 were French, 43 were from the UK, 40 from Denmark, 19 each were Japanese and Italian, 13 from Germany, 10 from Sweden, 9 each from Poland &amp; Israel, 6 each from Iran, Mexico and Norway. Others were from Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Brazil, Catalonia, Chile, Holland, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Korea, Lebanon, Mongolia, Romania, Spain, Turkey, Uganda, USSR and Venezuela.\n\nInitially I was hoping to take a sizable bite out of the many films I hadn't seen before. But the field is simply much too vast: There are too many masterpieces in Russian, Thai, Arabic, Flemish, Mandarin, Portuguese, Swiss and what-not. In the process, I also fell prey to \u201cNEWS\u201d, the 'Never-Ending Watchlist Syndrome', and ended up with a saved list of over 400 more selections waiting to be consumed.\n\nThe year was, to my surprise, also heavily populated by newer films, with 98 from 2021, 73 from 2020, a total of 406 from the last 10 years, and only 61 from before 1960. So, not much of Film-History flair either.\n\nOf the individual directors, I was mostly taken by Anders Thomas Jensen (10 films), Agn\u00e8s Varda (6), C\u00e9line Sciamma (4), Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (3), Thomas Vinterberg (5), Jeff Nichols (4), Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski (5), Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski (3), Asghar Farhadi (2), Andrey Zvyagintsev (2), Paolo Sorrentino (3), Susanne Bier (5), Kelly Reichardt (2), Tom McCarthy (7), Erroll Morris (4), Ramin Bahrani (4), Roy Andersson (2), Michael Haneke (5), Olivier Assayas (3), Steve McQueen (3), Gus Van Sant (5), Steven Soderbergh (9), Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve (2), Terry Zwigoff (3), Sydney Pollack (5) and Michael Winterbottom (4). All these on top of an already long list of old favorites, Kubrick, Fellini, Coen Bros., Truffaut, Bergman, Schrader, Chaplin, etc.\n\nI usually only write a couple of short personal paragraphs about each film, so if anybody's keen to read them, they're all [**Here**](https://tilbageidanmark.tumblr.com/tagged/movies).\n\nFinally, here are a few of the less-obvious jewels that I loved:\n\n**Metropia** (2009) by Swedish-Egyptian director Tarik Saleh was the most innovative and unusual film I\u2019ve never heard of during this project. A complex dystopic story which uses an uncanny hybrid of photoshoped photography and animation. An oppressive story about a paranoiac Moby-lookalike man who hears voices in his head and stumbles upon a European conspiracy related to a massive Metro train network. But it\u2019s so grey &amp; so strange! 10/10. Highly recommended.\n\nI\u2019m been obsessed by the Danish films of Anders Thomas Jensen, a masterful director and prolific screenwriter. I saw his **Riders of Justice** (2020) at least 5-6 times. A tight revenge story with the same ensemble cast he usually collaborates with, including Mads Mikkelsen, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Nicolas Bro.\n\nSame goes for ATJ's manuscript **After the Wedding** (2006), directed by Susanne Bier. Another tortured-looking Mads Mikkelsen, this time as an ex-patriot manager of a small Indian orphanage. Here he re-visits Denmark to secure a large donation promised by a rich benefactor, and things do not end up as they start. Intense and sensitive, with many quiet close-ups, mostly on everybody\u2019s eyes.\n\n**The Station Agent** (2003), Tom McCarthy\u2019s first film, before he wrote 'UP' and directed 'Spotlight'. Unlikely friendship between a train-loving, withdrawn dwarf who moves to an abandoned train depot in rural NJ, a depressed artist who lost her son, and a gregarious Cuban hotdog seller. Quirky and heartfelt.\n\n**The M\u00e9li\u00e8s Mystery** (2021), a fascinating biography of magician, toy-maker, pioneer director, impresario and THE inventor of the cinema. Gave me a whole new appreciation for his work.\n\n**Ship of Theseus**, a philosophical 2012 Indian art-house masterpiece, based on the Heraclitus thought experiment that asks, if an object that has had all of its components replaced remains the same object. It tells 3 separate stories that are seemingly unrelated. The first introduces a young Egyptian photographer who is blind and creates her street art based on sounds she hears. The second is about a dying Jain monk, fighting to ban animal testing in India. The third is about a poor bricklayer whose stolen kidney was sold illegally to an unsuspecting Swedish man. The uniting finale is a moving reflection on Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave. It may not sound appealing, but the film is absolutely beautiful, surprising, compelling and original.\n\n**The Painter and the Thief** (2020): An emotional Norwegian documentary about an unexpected relationship between a painter and the drug-addict thief who stole two of her most important artworks  \u2026\u201dRanked as the best documentary film of 2020 by the BBC,The Washington Post, and The Boston Globe\u2026\u201d\n\nC\u00e9line Sciamma's 2011 delicate story **Tomboy**. A poetic tale of a 10-year-old girl who pretends to be a boy. Tender and genuine in that most of it is entrusted to the children who play themselves, very much like Truffaut\u2019s \u201cL'argent de poche\u201d.\n\n[Gy\u00f6rgy P\u00e1lfi\u2019s **Final Cut**](https://vimeo.com/205242711)[**, Ladies and Gentlemen**](https://vimeo.com/205242711) (2012), The ultimate supercut - a romantic experimental mash-up, made up of 450 clips from the most famous films in history.\n\n**In &amp; Of Itself** (2020) - A most astounding performance by Derek DelGaudio, combining elements from Lennart Green, Spalding Gray, Ricky Jay, Laurie Anderson, Derren Brown, Marina Abramovi\u0107, et al. into an emotional personal journey. Directed by Frank Oz.\n\nPawe\u0142 Pawlikowski's disastrous love story [**Cold War**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=uFLdFtjuuoc) (2018), started with a group of ethnomusicologists searching the Polish countryside for old traditional folk sounds before they are lost forever, and ends 15 surprising years later at the most intense heartbreak. An absolute masterpiece - 10/10.\n\nDebra Granik's **Leave No Trace** (2018), the most reviewed (239) film to hold an approval rating of 100% on \u2018Rotten Tomatoes\u2019. A veteran father suffering from PTSD who lives off the grid in a forest near Portland, Oregon together with his 13 year old daughter. It\u2019s the same story arch as 'Captain Fantastic', but even better. The bonds between the two are painful and deep. The survival story is balanced and deeply touching.\n\nFirst glorious watch - Wong Kar-Wai\u2019s romantic [**Chungking Express**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=9wDd6TU4cls), with Tony Leung &amp; Faye Wong. I always thought it was an action flick, (probably because it\u00a0\u201cwas Tarantino\u2019s favorite movie\u201d) so I avoided it until now.\n\nHiromasa Yonebayashi worked for Ghibli for 18 years before leaving in 2014 to establish his own Studio Ponoc. It is obvious that he sees himself as heir apparent to Hayao Miyazaki, and deservedly so. **Mary and the Witch\u2019s Flower** (2017) was the first film he directed there. A psychedelic fairy tale about another young girl who becomes a witch combines the emotional twists from \u2018Spirited Away\u2019, basic story from \u2018Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service\u2019 and Ponyo\u2019s magic, together with Harry Potter adventures. The animation kept changing unexpectedly at least 10-15 times into new, phantasmagorical styles.\n\n**Tim's Vermeer** (2013): A Texas inventor becomes convinced that 17 century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer used an optical camera obscura device to achieve his photographic quality, so he set up to recreate The Music Lesson, in spite of never having picked up a paintbrush before. Created by Penn &amp; Teller, and directed by Teller.\n\nMike Nichols first film **Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?** (1966), a scathing play of humiliation and co-dependency. With vicious performances by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and just as magnificent score by Alex North. The only modern film to be nominated in every eligible Oscar category. I imagined Jon Hamm &amp; Elizabeth Moss casted as George &amp; Martha in a Broadway production of it.\n\n**African Kung Fu Nazis**, the first Ghanaian film I ever saw: A bizarre, super-low-budget ($20,000) satire with absurd plot: Hitler and Emperor Tojo did not die, but fled to Ghana, where, years later, they reverse the aging process and start a brand new bid for world domination. With his right-hand man, Horse-Man G\u00f6ring, Hitler brainwashes the locals into joining a new army \u2013 the Ghan-Aryans. Only a plucky underdog from the Shadow Snake kung fu school, can save them. (Not a good film, but noteworthy).\n\n**The Aerial (\u201dLa Antena\u201d)**, an innovative Argentinian silent film from 2007,\u00a0 about a city that had lost its voice, and its only savior, a boy without eyes who is crucified on a Star of David. It\u2019s a surreal allegory in German expressionism style, a weird black &amp; white fantasy about mind control. In short, a unique and inaccessible fairy tale.\n\nDozens of other outstanding films stimulated, delighted, captivated me again and again: Sorkin's **Molly\u2019s Game**, **The other side of hope** by Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki, Udo Kier's **Swan Song**, Jacques Demy's **The Umbrellas of Cherbourg**,  Anna Kendrick in **A Simple Favor**, **Claire\u2019s Camera**, Pixar's **Soul**, **Carol**, **Au Revoir les Enfants**, Etc. Etc. Etc. But then, everybody has their own hierarchy of top rating favorites.\n\nPlease check out [**the complete list of reviews**](https://tilbageidanmark.tumblr.com/tagged/movies), agree or disagree with any of my assessments, and respond in any way you like.\n\nI created a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQR74v-UIH_E0m1MynK9CAZROdfJCS10vNHWBUr-cX8Hh_afWeYft3jO0StnxFd1w6ckQlzZ0Pnp09F/pubhtml) with the basic data.\n\nMurky Buckets.",

Quirky and heartfelt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The M\u00e9li\u00e8s Mystery&lt;/strong&gt; (2021), a fascinating biography of magician, toy-maker, pioneer director, impresario and THE inventor of the cinema. Gave me a whole new appreciation for his work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship of Theseus&lt;/strong&gt;, a philosophical 2012 Indian art-house masterpiece, based on the Heraclitus thought experiment that asks, if an object that has had all of its components replaced remains the same object. It tells 3 separate stories that are seemingly unrelated. The first introduces a young Egyptian photographer who is blind and creates her street art based on sounds she hears. The second is about a dying Jain monk, fighting to ban animal testing in India. The third is about a poor bricklayer whose stolen kidney was sold illegally to an unsuspecting Swedish man. The uniting finale is a moving reflection on Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave. It may not sound appealing, but the film is absolutely beautiful, surprising, compelling and original.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Painter and the Thief&lt;/strong&gt; (2020): An emotional Norwegian documentary about an unexpected relationship between a painter and the drug-addict thief who stole two of her most important artworks  \u2026\u201dRanked as the best documentary film of 2020 by the BBC,The Washington Post, and The Boston Globe\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C\u00e9line Sciamma&amp;#39;s 2011 delicate story &lt;strong&gt;Tomboy&lt;/strong&gt;. A poetic tale of a 10-year-old girl who pretends to be a boy. Tender and genuine in that most of it is entrusted to the children who play themselves, very much like Truffaut\u2019s \u201cL&amp;#39;argent de poche\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://vimeo.com/205242711\"&gt;Gy\u00f6rgy P\u00e1lfi\u2019s &lt;strong&gt;Final Cut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://vimeo.com/205242711\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, Ladies and Gentlemen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2012), The ultimate supercut - a romantic experimental mash-up, made up of 450 clips from the most famous films in history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In &amp;amp; Of Itself&lt;/strong&gt; (2020) - A most astounding performance by Derek DelGaudio, combining elements from Lennart Green, Spalding Gray, Ricky Jay, Laurie Anderson, Derren Brown, Marina Abramovi\u0107, et al. into an emotional personal journey. Directed by Frank Oz.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski&amp;#39;s disastrous love story &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=uFLdFtjuuoc\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2018), started with a group of ethnomusicologists searching the Polish countryside for old traditional folk sounds before they are lost forever, and ends 15 surprising years later at the most intense heartbreak. An absolute masterpiece - 10/10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Debra Granik&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Leave No Trace&lt;/strong&gt; (2018), the most reviewed (239) film to hold an approval rating of 100% on \u2018Rotten Tomatoes\u2019. A veteran father suffering from PTSD who lives off the grid in a forest near Portland, Oregon together with his 13 year old daughter. It\u2019s the same story arch as &amp;#39;Captain Fantastic&amp;#39;, but even better. The bonds between the two are painful and deep. The survival story is balanced and deeply touching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First glorious watch - Wong Kar-Wai\u2019s romantic &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=9wDd6TU4cls\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chungking Express&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with Tony Leung &amp;amp; Faye Wong. I always thought it was an action flick, (probably because it\u00a0\u201cwas Tarantino\u2019s favorite movie\u201d) so I avoided it until now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hiromasa Yonebayashi worked for Ghibli for 18 years before leaving in 2014 to establish his own Studio Ponoc. It is obvious that he sees himself as heir apparent to Hayao Miyazaki, and deservedly so. &lt;strong&gt;Mary and the Witch\u2019s Flower&lt;/strong&gt; (2017) was the first film he directed there. A psychedelic fairy tale about another young girl who becomes a witch combines the emotional twists from \u2018Spirited Away\u2019, basic story from \u2018Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service\u2019 and Ponyo\u2019s magic, together with Harry Potter adventures. The animation kept changing unexpectedly at least 10-15 times into new, phantasmagorical styles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim&amp;#39;s Vermeer&lt;/strong&gt; (2013): A Texas inventor becomes convinced that 17 century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer used an optical camera obscura device to achieve his photographic quality, so he set up to recreate The Music Lesson, in spite of never having picked up a paintbrush before. Created by Penn &amp;amp; Teller, and directed by Teller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike Nichols first film &lt;strong&gt;Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&lt;/strong&gt; (1966), a scathing play of humiliation and co-dependency. With vicious performances by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and just as magnificent score by Alex North. The only modern film to be nominated in every eligible Oscar category. I imagined Jon Hamm &amp;amp; Elizabeth Moss casted as George &amp;amp; Martha in a Broadway production of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;African Kung Fu Nazis&lt;/strong&gt;, the first Ghanaian film I ever saw: A bizarre, super-low-budget ($20,000) satire with absurd plot: Hitler and Emperor Tojo did not die, but fled to Ghana, where, years later, they reverse the aging process and start a brand new bid for world domination. With his right-hand man, Horse-Man G\u00f6ring, Hitler brainwashes the locals into joining a new army \u2013 the Ghan-Aryans. Only a plucky underdog from the Shadow Snake kung fu school, can save them. (Not a good film, but noteworthy).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Aerial (\u201dLa Antena\u201d)&lt;/strong&gt;, an innovative Argentinian silent film from 2007,\u00a0 about a city that had lost its voice, and its only savior, a boy without eyes who is crucified on a Star of David. It\u2019s a surreal allegory in German expressionism style, a weird black &amp;amp; white fantasy about mind control. In short, a unique and inaccessible fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dozens of other outstanding films stimulated, delighted, captivated me again and again: Sorkin&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Molly\u2019s Game&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;The other side of hope&lt;/strong&gt; by Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki, Udo Kier&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Swan Song&lt;/strong&gt;, Jacques Demy&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&lt;/strong&gt;,  Anna Kendrick in &lt;strong&gt;A Simple Favor&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Claire\u2019s Camera&lt;/strong&gt;, Pixar&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Soul&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Carol&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Au Revoir les Enfants&lt;/strong&gt;, Etc. Etc. Etc.

    "title": "Isle of Dogs and Japanese culture",
    "content": "I watched Wes Anderson's *Isle of Dogs* a while ago. It was overall a generally decent movie with beautiful visuals, a good soundtrack, and nice chemistry between Atari, Chief, and Spots. The film is probably the most Japanese Western film ever made what with the architecture, clothing, woodblock art, almost all of the named human characters (barring Tracy Walker and Interpreter Nelson) and the language, most of which is not translated (aside from the interpreters and blocks of text), not to mention that Anderson named Akira Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki as the biggest inspirations behind *Isle of Dogs* along with Rankin/Bass, *The Plague Dogs*, *Come Home, Snoopy* and *101 Dalmatians*. The crew even had one Japanese writer (Kunichi Nomura) on board and he voiced the film's main antagonist, Mayor Kobayashi.\n\nWith all that said, there were debates over the movie's depiction of Japanese culture with some seeing it as \"cultural appropriation\" while others saw it as an affectionate tribute. As noted earlier, *Isle of Dogs* has tons of Japanese cultural references including (but not limited to) taiko drums, haiku, samurai, sumo, kabuki, cherry blossoms, sushi, mushroom clouds, Zen gardens, wasabi, Yakuza and an incident inspired by the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in 2011. For comparison's sake, it would be like if a Japanese anime studio made a movie set in a fictional American metropolis in the future sending its dogs to an uninhabited island off the coast with almost all of the humans being voiced by Western voice actors while the dogs were voiced by big name Japanese film/TV actors and it was inspired by the likes of Walt Disney and Steven Spielberg with a lot of nods to American culture (i.e. football and burgers). It should be noted that Anderson has said that *Isle of Dogs* is not meant to be an accurate depiction of any particular period in Japanese history hence why Atari becomes mayor of Megasaki despite being too young and not having a seat in the *Shugiin* (House of Representatives) or the *Sangiin* (House of Councilors), that said his crew did look to 1950s-60s Showa era culture for reference in crafting the world in addition to basing Trash Island on the real-life Hashima Island off the coast of Nagasaki. \n\nThere were also complaints about Tracy as a \"white savior\" because of her role as the leader of a pro-Dog activist group and the one who recovers the cure for canine flu as well as ending up with Atari despite him never personally knowing her and no buildup whatsoever to their \"relationship\" though she is far from the only one who puts a stop to Kobayashi's plan to exterminate all natural-born dogs and this issue might have been rectified if she had been Japanese-American instead of Caucasian fitting in with the rest of the cast while still giving us the American perspective on what's going on in Megasaki.\n\nFor the film itself, I embrace *Isle of Dogs* for what it is, a love letter to not just dogs but also Japan in general. It is still Atari's story as much as it's the dogs since he wants to find Spot and he leads them back to Megasaki.",

    "content": "# Rule Trial Conclusions\nFollowing up from the rule updates from [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/recdgr/livestreamfail_ruleset_updating_to_address/) we'd like to keep you posted on the results, and where we'll go from there. Users have generally said that the change has improved content on LSF, but it has not completely solved the core issues that plague LSF. Common forms of brigading and low-value drama posts involving LSF were significantly curbed - but it is clear, that these efforts are not enough. \n\nThe main criticism for this rule was that it didn't go far enough since it does not solve brigading altogether. While impossible to solve given the lack of tools that we have to monitor inorganic activity, we hope to instead reduce the value of brigading by targeting petty drama content directly. \n\nWe feel like some threads that bring attention to problems in the space and general news should be posts that belong on LSF and are valuable in some way. That being said, a single topic should almost never take up the entire front page. Recent events such as Twitch banning 'cracker', and the recent Twitch DMCA news are topics that belong on LSF. We believe that one or two posts should be sufficient, so we are enforcing new rules to maintain this new standard, along with rewrites and clarifications to our overall ruleset.\n\n# New rules and rule-rewrites\n\nOur first and major rule change is an update to our Rule 3.2: Duplicate Submissions. Starting immediately, you may not post any tweets about any topic already covered in another thread on LSF within the last 7 days. We are granting exceptions to official Twitch update announcements (bans are included here) and large community events from streamers (such as ShitCamp and NymN's awards). \nHere's the new updated rule, marking in bold the changes.\n\n&gt; Duplicate submissions will be removed to keep the subreddit fresh, **this also applies to clips announcing the same thing but via different mediums (Tweets, News articles)**. The submission we keep will generally either be the clip with the best timing, or the clip posted first. **Tweets must also not be related to any topic from any thread within the last 7 days. This does not apply to official news/events/announcements, granted they are different enough from the original.**\n\nWe believe that this rule will prevent dogpiling and the majority of \"Streamer takes\" from taking up the front page, and thus reducing the amount of posts about a single topic. Since clips don't fall under this category, streamer takes about an existing topic can still be posted. However, we will be more proactive in noticing if a topic is taking up front page. In case that this still happens we may create a megathread compiling the clips and removing further clips about the topic. \n\nNext up are some rule rewrites to clarify what we mean by politics and an update to an outdated rule. Starting with our Rule 2: Politics. This change clarifies what we mean by politics:\n\n&gt; Politics are out of scope for LSF, so any content related to politics will be removed. **Politics is defined as the activities associated with the governance of a country or other area.** The common census among users is that, for the sake of not having to draw blurry lines that leave space for individual bias and animosity between mods, it would be best to also be more strict with content that isn't inherently political, but carries a political intent or message nonetheless. This affects, for example, streams with a campaigning background regardless of the content shown, and podcasts.\n\n&gt; Exceptions are made when the content directly relates to gaming and/or streaming. Examples of such exceptions are the Blizzard-Hong Kong controversy in 2019, or streamers talking about the effect of Article 13 on the industry.\n\nA good way to consider whether a potentially political submission is suitable for LSF is to pay attention to whether the content is entirely US-centric (or whatever country it may be about) or whether it can be applied to a more global context. A common example is allowing COVID threads but not CDC debates (such as the Twomad and Hasan drama). COVID and vaccine discussion are topics that are general enough where it can be applied to a global discussion. Discussions about the motives behind the CDC mandates are not global and strictly US-centric and government related. \n\nFinally, we re-wrote Rule 7 about flairs to reflect our flair changes (this rule was severely outdated). \n\n# Megathreading\n\nWe will be making more aggressive decisions to megathread high-intensity drama such as the recent DMCA concern. The aim here is to allow for meaningful and centralized discussion of a topic without it becoming an unmanageable storm on the front page that can be manipulated by brigaders, bad-faith contributors, drama-bait, and harassment. Furthermore, it will help ensure that LSF is always somewhere to find nice clips when you aren\u2019t interested in the metapolitics of streaming culture. This will include situations that involve many \u201cX streamer reacts to Y streamer\u201d.\n\n# Rules 1.1 and 1.2 Enforcement\n\nWe have been enforcing our rules against harassment and discrimination far more aggressively, to what seems like better results. You can expect that we will be even less lenient on what comments are allowed through. Good-faith criticism and freedom of discussion are important, so avoid being hateful or insulting in your comments, as they may be removed entirely on those inclusions, even if the rest of the comment is otherwise fine. You can say someone\u2019s action was dumb without insulting their overall intelligence or any of their inherent features.\n\n# LSF and the DMCA drama\n\nOver the past few months, your collective feedback has made it clear that we must design our mission around shaping LSF in a way that prioritizes diverse, funny, and interesting clips, while still allowing for interesting news and updates about the live-streaming space. This balance is something that can quickly become out of control, as it had on January 8th and 9th. \n\nThe front page was quickly taken over by a fervent topic: Streamers watching DMCA content on stream. \n\nThis spiraled out of control when [Hasan requested to get himself banned from LSF](https://clips.twitch.tv/NiceJazzyDiamondPeteZarollTie-ykUYi5ql-d_JIsou). We deeply empathize with feeling targeted harassment from such a big community, and we are left disappointed about how the situation played out. Typically, streamers (and/or their mods) initiate contact with us through direct lines of communications that we put in place for them to develop a solution for this kind of situation, however, it wasn\u2019t used in this case. Unfortunately, given the speed and chaos of the situation, we had to act based on what was being indirectly communicated to us via the clip above, and via the thousands of comments urging us to ban Hasan resulting from that action. Our attempts to reach out directly had failed, but we are continuing outreach to rebuild connections.\n\nIn the past few months, our team has changed drastically, and is deeply focused on improving the safety and civility of LSF - it is our main priority. That being said, we have a lot to catch up on given how long LSF has been around, and we're just a team of volunteers, so we are urging the users to help us with reporting rule-breaking or concerning content. We put in significant daily effort across the team beyond what is reasonable, healthy, and expected for a typical volunteer moderation team - to the point where with even triple the staff, we would still be struggling, because LSF is a particularly complex community that needs to be solved with policies, rather than sheer personnel. \n\nWhen streamers feel unsafe enough to request a ban (or force it), we consider it a wake-up call to review our policies, enforcement, and to call upon the community to play a role in working towards improvement. We're using this situation as a learning experience to make things better, and we're hoping that with your help, we can finally redeem this subreddit through empathetic, safety-focused, and meaningful policy decisions.\n\nWith our new team and new goals, LSF has significantly tightened its rules, put new policies in place to curb drama/harassment, and collected data to encourage posts from a greater diversity of streamers. Our reward has generally been harassment from commenters, streamers singling us out to their fanbases, and constant accusations that none of our efforts have mattered. We hope that our upcoming changes will finally shift things back to our vision.\n\n\nThe LSF Mod Team.",

We believe that one or two posts should be sufficient, so we are enforcing new rules to maintain this new standard, along with rewrites and clarifications to our overall ruleset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;New rules and rule-rewrites&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our first and major rule change is an update to our Rule 3.2: Duplicate Submissions. Starting immediately, you may not post any tweets about any topic already covered in another thread on LSF within the last 7 days. We are granting exceptions to official Twitch update announcements (bans are included here) and large community events from streamers (such as ShitCamp and NymN&amp;#39;s awards). \nHere&amp;#39;s the new updated rule, marking in bold the changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Duplicate submissions will be removed to keep the subreddit fresh, &lt;strong&gt;this also applies to clips announcing the same thing but via different mediums (Tweets, News articles)&lt;/strong&gt;. The submission we keep will generally either be the clip with the best timing, or the clip posted first. &lt;strong&gt;Tweets must also not be related to any topic from any thread within the last 7 days. This does not apply to official news/events/announcements, granted they are different enough from the original.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that this rule will prevent dogpiling and the majority of &amp;quot;Streamer takes&amp;quot; from taking up the front page, and thus reducing the amount of posts about a single topic. Since clips don&amp;#39;t fall under this category, streamer takes about an existing topic can still be posted. However, we will be more proactive in noticing if a topic is taking up front page. In case that this still happens we may create a megathread compiling the clips and removing further clips about the topic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next up are some rule rewrites to clarify what we mean by politics and an update to an outdated rule. Starting with our Rule 2: Politics. This change clarifies what we mean by politics:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Politics are out of scope for LSF, so any content related to politics will be removed. &lt;strong&gt;Politics is defined as the activities associated with the governance of a country or other area.&lt;/strong&gt; The common census among users is that, for the sake of not having to draw blurry lines that leave space for individual bias and animosity between mods, it would be best to also be more strict with content that isn&amp;#39;t inherently political, but carries a political intent or message nonetheless. This affects, for example, streams with a campaigning background regardless of the content shown, and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exceptions are made when the content directly relates to gaming and/or streaming. Examples of such exceptions are the Blizzard-Hong Kong controversy in 2019, or streamers talking about the effect of Article 13 on the industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good way to consider whether a potentially political submission is suitable for LSF is to pay attention to whether the content is entirely US-centric (or whatever country it may be about) or whether it can be applied to a more global context. A common example is allowing COVID threads but not CDC debates (such as the Twomad and Hasan drama). COVID and vaccine discussion are topics that are general enough where it can be applied to a global discussion. Discussions about the motives behind the CDC mandates are not global and strictly US-centric and government related. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, we re-wrote Rule 7 about flairs to reflect our flair changes (this rule was severely outdated). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Megathreading&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will be making more aggressive decisions to megathread high-intensity drama such as the recent DMCA concern. The aim here is to allow for meaningful and centralized discussion of a topic without it becoming an unmanageable storm on the front page that can be manipulated by brigaders, bad-faith contributors, drama-bait, and harassment. Furthermore, it will help ensure that LSF is always somewhere to find nice clips when you aren\u2019t interested in the metapolitics of streaming culture. This will include situations that involve many \u201cX streamer reacts to Y streamer\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Rules 1.1 and 1.2 Enforcement&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have been enforcing our rules against harassment and discrimination far more aggressively, to what seems like better results. You can expect that we will be even less lenient on what comments are allowed through. Good-faith criticism and freedom of discussion are important, so avoid being hateful or insulting in your comments, as they may be removed entirely on those inclusions, even if the rest of the comment is otherwise fine. You can say someone\u2019s action was dumb without insulting their overall intelligence or any of their inherent features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;LSF and the DMCA drama&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, your collective feedback has made it clear that we must design our mission around shaping LSF in a way that prioritizes diverse, funny, and interesting clips, while still allowing for interesting news and updates about the live-streaming space. This balance is something that can quickly become out of control, as it had on January 8th and 9th. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The front page was quickly taken over by a fervent topic: Streamers watching DMCA content on stream. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This spiraled out of control when &lt;a href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/NiceJazzyDiamondPeteZarollTie-ykUYi5ql-d_JIsou\"&gt;Hasan requested to get himself banned from LSF&lt;/a&gt;. We deeply empathize with feeling targeted harassment from such a big community, and we are left disappointed about how the situation played out. Typically, streamers (and/or their mods) initiate contact with us through direct lines of communications that we put in place for them to develop a solution for this kind of situation, however, it wasn\u2019t used in this case. Unfortunately, given the speed and chaos of the situation, we had to act based on what was being indirectly communicated to us via the clip above, and via the thousands of comments urging us to ban Hasan resulting from that action. Our attempts to reach out directly had failed, but we are continuing outreach to rebuild connections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the past few months, our team has changed drastically, and is deeply focused on improving the safety and civility of LSF - it is our main priority. That being said, we have a lot to catch up on given how long LSF has been around, and we&amp;#39;re just a team of volunteers, so we are urging the users to help us with reporting rule-breaking or concerning content. We put in significant daily effort across the team beyond what is reasonable, healthy, and expected for a typical volunteer moderation team - to the point where with even triple the staff, we would still be struggling, because LSF is a particularly complex community that needs to be solved with policies, rather than sheer personnel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When streamers feel unsafe enough to request a ban (or force it), we consider it a wake-up call to review our policies, enforcement, and to call upon the community to play a role in working towards improvement. We&amp;#39;re using this situation as a learning experience to make things better, and we&amp;#39;re hoping that with your help, we can finally redeem this subreddit through empathetic, safety-focused, and meaningful policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With our new team and new goals, LSF has significantly tightened its rules, put new policies in place to curb drama/harassment, and collected data to encourage posts from a greater diversity of streamers. Our reward has generally been harassment from commenters, streamers singling us out to their fanbases, and constant accusations that none of our efforts have mattered. We hope that our upcoming changes will finally shift things back to our vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The LSF Mod Team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "title": "How to Clear A Study In Potions (All Silver Medals) ONLY using Trial Characters.",
    "content": "Ignore the banter between me and my friends. I just thought of recording this while we were chilling on discord after dinner. Feel free to mute if it's distracting.\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1GKKBTegY)\n\n**This video shows:**\n\n- Clearing the entire event only using the trial characters (e.g. zero input on your actual account's strength)\n- Getting Silver Medals on all challenges (getting all the primogems for this event)\n- The order below is the order in which I did the stages\n- All stages were done at 1x Multiplier\n\n**Timestamped Video of the Relevant Stage in the Links Below**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DAY ONE**\n\n[***Stage Three: Enhanced Sample***\n](https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY)\n\n- All of the enemies at the beginning are Hydro Mimics\n- The last wave has three Fatui guys\n\n***Team Comp: Yoimiya + YunJin***\n\n\n**Potions:**\n\n1.) Deflagration - When you do a *Vaporize* reaction, the monster that got vaporized will let out an explosion and damage everyone around it.\n\n2.) Resonance Potion - After Attacking with an infused normal attack, you gain up to 20% damage increase for all you care.\n\n3.) Amp: Progressive Assault - After using an Elemental Burst (Q), all your characters' attacks will regen a bunch of energy for 12 seconds\n\n**Combat notes (In case you don't know anything about these characters):**\n\n**YOIMIYA**\n\n- Yoimiya's Charge attack (aiming) sucks. Don't use it.\n\n- When you use Yoimiya's skill (E), all of her normal attacks are infused with Pyro (they do fire damage) for a while. This lets you Vaporize all the Hydro mimics (Potion 1) and causes you to gain more damage from Potion 2.\n\n- Yoimiya's Elemental Burst (Q) does some damage over time to one target. That's really all I know about that skill.\n\n**YUNJIN**\n\n- Her Skill (E) just does some Geo damage when you press it. If you hold it, you do more damage and recharge energy faster (preferred). If you press it right as you get hit, you do the more-damage version (even more preferred).\n\n- Her Burst (Q) does some Geo Damage and makes some flags float around you. As long as those flags are floating around you, all your characters do more Normal Damage (important for Yoimiya).\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nPress YunJin's Burst (Q) FIRST, and then Switch to Yoimiya. Use Yoimiya's Skill (E) and then normal attack away while YunJin's flags float around you.\n\nEither Hold YunJin's (E) all the way or try to time it perfectly to counterhit in order to recharge her Burst (Q) faster.\n\nIn the final wave with the Fatui, kill the water guy first since he heals, then damage the lightning guy as much as you can before he puts up his shield, since you don't have an element that can kill that shield very fast.\n\nYou can use Yoimiya's burst (Q) whenever you want, I didn't really pay much attention to it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[***Stage Two: Dosage Increase***](https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=147)\n\n- Just a bunch of Hilichurls\n\n***Team Comp: Kazuha + Beidou***\n\n**Potions:**\n\n1.) Convection Potion - Whenever you Swirl React, your party gets more damage for a while.\n\n2.) Slow-Release Potion - Your Skills (E) regenerate your Bursts (Q) faster.\n\n**Combat Notes**\n\n- Beidou's Burst (Q) sends out a lightning bolt that damages whoever you hit with a normal attack. That lightning bolt can bounce back and forth between enemies a few times doing damage every time. This is why Beidou is busted af.\n\n- Beidou's Skill (E) works the same way as Yunjin's for all you care. Except because of the potions, you can just tap the skill and do fine.\n\n- Kazuha's Skill (E) sucks in enemies and launches them in the air along with you. You can plunge attack afterwards for some more damage. Use this liberally.\n\n- Kazuha's Burst (Q) does some damage and makes your Beidou stronger or something idk. Who cares, use it whenever it's up.\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nGroup them all up with Kazuha's Skill (E) and then Beidou Burst (Q) and watch everything die from chain lightning. Spam any other skill you have if they're up. That's about it.\n\nNormal attack with Kazuha instead of Beidou since he attacks faster = more chain lightning bolts during Beidou Burst (Q).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[***Stage One: Sublimation Verification***](https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=273)\n\n- Some enemies that hit kind hard at the end.\n\n***Team Comp: Yoimiya + YunJin***\n\n\n**Potions:**\n\n1.) Honing Potion - You just do more damage.\n\n2.) Amp: Switch Standby - Whenever you swap characters, your party gets more damage.\n\n3.) Parallel Potion - Whenever you use a Skill (E), your other party member's Skill (E) has its cooldown cut in half.\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nSame as the first stage, except maybe kill the ice archers ASAP so you don't destroy your spacebar like I did.\n\nOne of the Geovishaps at the end has a glowing yellow aura around it. Kill that one first since that aura makes it so the ground you're standing on will glow red for a second, and then start damaging you if you stand in it. Since you have no healer, try to not stand in it and kill the Vishap with it so it stops.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[***Stage Four: Peak Study:***](https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=455)\n\n- A bunch of Humans and then Some Fatui and Mirror Maiden at the end\n\n***Team Comp: Kazuha + Beidou***\n\n**Potions:**\n\n1.) Amp: Cyclical Assault - After you use a Burst (Q), the rest of your party gets stronger Bursts (Q) for a while.\n\n2.) Intensifying Potion - You do more damage and take more damage.\n\n3.) Firming Potion - You get more Defense.\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nSame as before, really. The human dudes die quick when you group them + Beidou Burst (Q) and when the Fatui spawn, just kill the Electro hammer dude first before his shield comes up, and then focus the Maiden.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DAY TWO**\n\n[***Stage Four: Peak Study***](https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=598)\n\n- A bunch of robots. The smaller robots will heal the really big robot, so try to group them to damage them all at once.\n\n**Team Comp: Keqing + YunJin**\n\n**Potions**\n\n1.) Resonance Potion - After Attacking with an infused normal attack, you gain up to 20% damage increase for all you care.\n\n2.) Honing Potion - You just do more damage.\n\n**Combat Notes**\n\n- YunJin works the same way as before, so if you made it work before, you're basically there.\n\n- Keqing's Skill (E) shoots out a feather and does damage (it auto aims). Press the Skill (E) again and you teleport there. Your normal attacks for the next few seconds will now do Electro damage instead of physical. You can double tap the skill (E) to infuse faster.\n\n- Keqing's Burst (Q) just damages enemies around you for a bunch of hits. Only really use this if you need to dodge a hit (you're invincible while the animation plays out) or if there's a bunch of enemies grouped around you.\n\n- Keqing's last normal hit (5th hit) in her combo will make her dash through an enemy if they aren't too chubby. You can use this to prevent yourself from getting cornered when all the robots swarm you.\n\n- Don't bother using Keqing's charged attacks despite whatever you read on a Keqing guide. YunJin makes your normals stronger, remember?\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nMost of the enemies will group up naturally, so try to damage the smaller guys + the big robot at the same time. If you have to choose, kill the smaller ones first since they heal the big robot gradually.\n\nMake use of Keqing's burst (Q) if you think you can't dodge all the hits. Punching some of the robots when they start charging up a laser with whatever skill or normal hit you got will stun them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[***Stage Three: Enhanced Sample***](https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=759)\n\n- A bunch of Pyro enemies and then An Abyss Lector (Electro)\n\n***Team Comp: Chongyun + Shenhe***\n\n**Potions**\n\n1.) Amp: Cumulative Strike - when you punch someone with your Normal Attack, your other character regenerates energy once every few seconds.\n\n2.) Amp: Fierce Pursuit - You attack and run faster for a while after killing an enemy.\n\n3.) Slow-Release Potion - You regenerate more energy whenever your Skill (E) hits something.\n\n**Combat Notes**\n\n- IDK what Shenhe actually does. Word on the street is after you use her skills (E) and burst (Q), your party does extra Cryo damage or something. So spam these abilities before switching off to Chongyun.\n\n- Chongyun's Skill (E) makes an area on the ground. As long as you stand in it, all your Normal hits do Cryo damage instead of physical. (so Shenhe makes them stronger, I think)\n\n- Chongyun's Burst (Q) just nukes whatever is in front of you with Cryo damage. Spam this shit. It can hit multiple enemies so try to group them together if you can.\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nJust basically spam as many abilities as you can, and when there's nothing to spam, punch things with Chongyun.\n\nTry to be smart about placing your Chongyuns Skill (E) so you don't have to leave it to punch things.\n\nWhen the Lector has his Electro shield up, spam Cryo damage as fast as you can to break it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[***Stage Two: Dosage Increase***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1GKKBTegY)\n\n- More humans and a Fatui agent and a Mirror Maiden\n\n***Team Comp: Keqing + YunJin***\n\n**Potions**\n\n1.) Dielectric Potion - Keqing might do some more damage sometimes. (not likely, idk why I picked it)\n\n2.) Intensifying Potion - You do more damage and take more damage.\n\n3.) Amp: Redoubled Pursuit - You do more damage after Keqing double taps her skill (E).\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nBasically just run around and punch things with Keqing. You already know how YunJin works.\n\nYou can close distance quickly with Keqing's Skill (E).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[***Stage One: Sublimation Verification***](https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=1089)\n\n- This one was a little challenging and required a few retries to solve some things\n\n- It's just a bunch of weak Hilichurls at first and then two Geovishaps at the end, like a previous trial.\n\n***Team Comp: Chongyun + Shenhe***\n\n**Potions (I accidentally clipped this out of the video**\n\n1.) Explosive Potion - Bursts (Q) do more damage.\n\n2.) Amp: Adaptive Strike - You do more damage if you swap characters often. (meh)\n\n3.) Parallel Potion - Whenever you use a Skill (E), your other party member's Skill (E) has its cooldown cut in half.\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nThis one requires a bit of finesse. After killing all the archers that spawn at first, some of the Shaman dudes will spawn. One of them is Geo and will spawn about where you stand when you enter the arena. Kill this one ASAP as he'll put all the rest of the monsters onto totems and you waste like 10s trying to break them.\n\nGeovishap strategy is the same as before - kill the one with the yellow aura around it so you don't get the rockslide thing below you. The two Vishaps will naturally want to stand close to you so you have prime opportunities to nuke them both at once with Chongyuns burst (Q).\n\nPay careful attention to dodging in this arena since you don't have any reliable shielding, and there can be a lot of damage coming out from the Vishaps.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DAY THREE**\n\n[***Stage Four: Peak Study***](https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=1256)\n\n- A bunch of robots again\n\n- not a big deal\n\n***Team Comp: Qiqi + Sayu***\n\n**Potions**\n\n1.) Convection Potion - Whenever you Swirl React, your party gets more damage for a while.\n\n2.) Intensifying Potion - You do more damage and take more damage.\n\n3.) Parallel Potion - Whenever you use a Skill (E), your other party member's Skill (E) has its cooldown cut in half.\n\n**Combat Notes**\n\n- You can ignore corrosion because you'll be healing a buttload.\n\n- Spam Qiqi's Skill (E) and Burst (Q) whenever they're available, then switch to Sayu.\n\n- Use Sayu's Burst (Q) before using her skill (E).\n\n- When you use Sayu's Skill (E), make sure to HOLD the button for a second so she keeps rolling around after you let go of the button.\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nUse all your abilities whenever they're up, and use Sayu's skill (E) by HOLDING it, and then just keeping running her into the enemies to watch them die. Whenever Sayu's skill (E) is not available, switch to Qiqi and just normal attack.\n\nThat's about it. I was surprised how much easier this last day was to the others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[***Stage Two: Dosage Increase***](https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=1413)\n\n- A bunch of dogs\n\n- Honestly the enemy layout doesn't matter because the trial characters in this day don't really care what the enemies do.\n\n***Team Comp: Kokomi + Diona***\n\n**Potions**\n\n1.) Gravity Potion - You do more damage maybe (not actually sure with how Kokomi works, but you don't really care)\n\n2.) Resonance Potion - After Attacking with an infused normal attack, you gain up to 20% damage increase for all you care.\n\n**Combat Notes**\n\n- Kokomi's artifacts make it so you do damage to enemies around you based on how much you heal (overhealing counts). So, stand close to enemies while you punch them.\n\n- Kokomi's Skill (E) just lays down a jellyfish around you and heals you every once in a while.\n\n- After using Kokomi's Burst (Q), her normal attacks hit like a truck for about 7 seconds, so make sure you stay on her after bursting for a while.\n\n- Diona's abilities don't really matter but you can use her Burst (Q) before switching to Kokomi to help Kokomi freeze enemies.\n\n- You can use Diona's Skill (E) whenever it's available to get a shield.\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nUse Diona's abilities, then switch to Kokomi and use her Skill (E), then her Burst (Q), then just use Normal attacks for a while on her and rinse and repeat. Make sure you stand close to your enemies so her artifacts also do damage for you. Just punch everything until it's all dead, enemy damage doesn't really matter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[***Stage Three: Enhanced Sample***](https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=1542)\n\n- Basically just do the same thing as before with Sayu\n\n***Team Comp: Qiqi + Sayu***\n\n**Potions**\n\n1.) Amp: Proactive Assault - You more damage when you're above 80% HP (which is all the time).\n\n2.) Amp: Rousing Recovery - You do more damage after getting healed (which is all the time).\n\n3.) Slow-Release Potion - Your Skills (E) regenerate your Bursts (Q) faster.\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nSecond verse, same as the first. Just roll around after spamming all your abilities and watch things die. Just don't tap Sayu's Skill (E) like me and you'll clear way faster than I did.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[***Stage One: Sublimation Verification***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1GKKBTegY)\n\n- Kill the two Shaman dudes when they spawn because they heal the big guy.\n\n- That's really about it.\n\n***Team Comp: Kokomi + Diona***\n\n**Potions**\n\n1.) Amp: Rapid Recovery - Your healing is doubled (More damage for Kokomi's Artifact set).\n\n2.) Explosive Potion - Kokomi does more damage.\n\n3.) Amp: Rapid Assault - After you Sprint (Shift/Right Click), you attack faster.\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nJust make sure to kill the two shamans that spawn (this will happen twice) ASAP to reduce how much the big guys get healed. Other than that, Potion 3 makes it so Kokomi turns into a machine gun.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThat's about it. Collect Primos and go back to wondering why Spiral Abyss powercreep is so unfair or something.\n\nFor reference, out of the 11 characters available for trial, I own 6 of them (Beidou, Keqing, Chongyun, Qiqi, Sayu, and Diona). And out of those six, I really only am familiar with three of them or used them in Spiral (Beidou, Keqing, Chongyun).\n\nIf you have any questions or troubles when following my notes, feel free to ask.",

Deflagration - When you do a &lt;em&gt;Vaporize&lt;/em&gt; reaction, the monster that got vaporized will let out an explosion and damage everyone around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Resonance Potion - After Attacking with an infused normal attack, you gain up to 20% damage increase for all you care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) Amp: Progressive Assault - After using an Elemental Burst (Q), all your characters&amp;#39; attacks will regen a bunch of energy for 12 seconds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combat notes (In case you don&amp;#39;t know anything about these characters):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOIMIYA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoimiya&amp;#39;s Charge attack (aiming) sucks. Don&amp;#39;t use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use Yoimiya&amp;#39;s skill (E), all of her normal attacks are infused with Pyro (they do fire damage) for a while. This lets you Vaporize all the Hydro mimics (Potion 1) and causes you to gain more damage from Potion 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoimiya&amp;#39;s Elemental Burst (Q) does some damage over time to one target. That&amp;#39;s really all I know about that skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YUNJIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her Skill (E) just does some Geo damage when you press it. If you hold it, you do more damage and recharge energy faster (preferred). If you press it right as you get hit, you do the more-damage version (even more preferred).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her Burst (Q) does some Geo Damage and makes some flags float around you. As long as those flags are floating around you, all your characters do more Normal Damage (important for Yoimiya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Press YunJin&amp;#39;s Burst (Q) FIRST, and then Switch to Yoimiya. Use Yoimiya&amp;#39;s Skill (E) and then normal attack away while YunJin&amp;#39;s flags float around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either Hold YunJin&amp;#39;s (E) all the way or try to time it perfectly to counterhit in order to recharge her Burst (Q) faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the final wave with the Fatui, kill the water guy first since he heals, then damage the lightning guy as much as you can before he puts up his shield, since you don&amp;#39;t have an element that can kill that shield very fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can use Yoimiya&amp;#39;s burst (Q) whenever you want, I didn&amp;#39;t really pay much attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=147\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stage Two: Dosage Increase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Just a bunch of Hilichurls&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Comp: Kazuha + Beidou&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) Convection Potion - Whenever you Swirl React, your party gets more damage for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Slow-Release Potion - Your Skills (E) regenerate your Bursts (Q) faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combat Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beidou&amp;#39;s Burst (Q) sends out a lightning bolt that damages whoever you hit with a normal attack. That lightning bolt can bounce back and forth between enemies a few times doing damage every time. This is why Beidou is busted af.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beidou&amp;#39;s Skill (E) works the same way as Yunjin&amp;#39;s for all you care. Except because of the potions, you can just tap the skill and do fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuha&amp;#39;s Skill (E) sucks in enemies and launches them in the air along with you. You can plunge attack afterwards for some more damage. Use this liberally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuha&amp;#39;s Burst (Q) does some damage and makes your Beidou stronger or something idk. Who cares, use it whenever it&amp;#39;s up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Group them all up with Kazuha&amp;#39;s Skill (E) and then Beidou Burst (Q) and watch everything die from chain lightning. Spam any other skill you have if they&amp;#39;re up. That&amp;#39;s about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normal attack with Kazuha instead of Beidou since he attacks faster = more chain lightning bolts during Beidou Burst (Q).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=273\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stage One: Sublimation Verification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some enemies that hit kind hard at the end.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Comp: Yoimiya + YunJin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) Honing Potion - You just do more damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Amp: Switch Standby - Whenever you swap characters, your party gets more damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) Parallel Potion - Whenever you use a Skill (E), your other party member&amp;#39;s Skill (E) has its cooldown cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as the first stage, except maybe kill the ice archers ASAP so you don&amp;#39;t destroy your spacebar like I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the Geovishaps at the end has a glowing yellow aura around it. Kill that one first since that aura makes it so the ground you&amp;#39;re standing on will glow red for a second, and then start damaging you if you stand in it. Since you have no healer, try to not stand in it and kill the Vishap with it so it stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=455\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stage Four: Peak Study:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A bunch of Humans and then Some Fatui and Mirror Maiden at the end&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Comp: Kazuha + Beidou&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) Amp: Cyclical Assault - After you use a Burst (Q), the rest of your party gets stronger Bursts (Q) for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Intensifying Potion - You do more damage and take more damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) Firming Potion - You get more Defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as before, really. The human dudes die quick when you group them + Beidou Burst (Q) and when the Fatui spawn, just kill the Electro hammer dude first before his shield comes up, and then focus the Maiden.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAY TWO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=598\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stage Four: Peak Study&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A bunch of robots. The smaller robots will heal the really big robot, so try to group them to damage them all at once.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Comp: Keqing + YunJin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) Resonance Potion - After Attacking with an infused normal attack, you gain up to 20% damage increase for all you care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.)

Press the Skill (E) again and you teleport there. Your normal attacks for the next few seconds will now do Electro damage instead of physical. You can double tap the skill (E) to infuse faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keqing&amp;#39;s Burst (Q) just damages enemies around you for a bunch of hits. Only really use this if you need to dodge a hit (you&amp;#39;re invincible while the animation plays out) or if there&amp;#39;s a bunch of enemies grouped around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keqing&amp;#39;s last normal hit (5th hit) in her combo will make her dash through an enemy if they aren&amp;#39;t too chubby. You can use this to prevent yourself from getting cornered when all the robots swarm you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t bother using Keqing&amp;#39;s charged attacks despite whatever you read on a Keqing guide. YunJin makes your normals stronger, remember?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the enemies will group up naturally, so try to damage the smaller guys + the big robot at the same time. If you have to choose, kill the smaller ones first since they heal the big robot gradually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make use of Keqing&amp;#39;s burst (Q) if you think you can&amp;#39;t dodge all the hits. Punching some of the robots when they start charging up a laser with whatever skill or normal hit you got will stun them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=759\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stage Three: Enhanced Sample&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A bunch of Pyro enemies and then An Abyss Lector (Electro)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Comp: Chongyun + Shenhe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.)

So spam these abilities before switching off to Chongyun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chongyun&amp;#39;s Skill (E) makes an area on the ground.

Intensifying Potion - You do more damage and take more damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) Amp: Redoubled Pursuit - You do more damage after Keqing double taps her skill (E).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically just run around and punch things with Keqing. You already know how YunJin works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can close distance quickly with Keqing&amp;#39;s Skill (E).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=1089\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stage One: Sublimation Verification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one was a little challenging and required a few retries to solve some things&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a bunch of weak Hilichurls at first and then two Geovishaps at the end, like a previous trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Comp: Chongyun + Shenhe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potions (I accidentally clipped this out of the video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) Explosive Potion - Bursts (Q) do more damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Amp: Adaptive Strike - You do more damage if you swap characters often. (meh)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) Parallel Potion - Whenever you use a Skill (E), your other party member&amp;#39;s Skill (E) has its cooldown cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one requires a bit of finesse. After killing all the archers that spawn at first, some of the Shaman dudes will spawn. One of them is Geo and will spawn about where you stand when you enter the arena. Kill this one ASAP as he&amp;#39;ll put all the rest of the monsters onto totems and you waste like 10s trying to break them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Geovishap strategy is the same as before - kill the one with the yellow aura around it so you don&amp;#39;t get the rockslide thing below you. The two Vishaps will naturally want to stand close to you so you have prime opportunities to nuke them both at once with Chongyuns burst (Q).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pay careful attention to dodging in this arena since you don&amp;#39;t have any reliable shielding, and there can be a lot of damage coming out from the Vishaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAY THREE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=1256\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stage Four: Peak Study&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bunch of robots again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;not a big deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Comp: Qiqi + Sayu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) Convection Potion - Whenever you Swirl React, your party gets more damage for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Intensifying Potion - You do more damage and take more damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) Parallel Potion - Whenever you use a Skill (E), your other party member&amp;#39;s Skill (E) has its cooldown cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combat Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can ignore corrosion because you&amp;#39;ll be healing a buttload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spam Qiqi&amp;#39;s Skill (E) and Burst (Q) whenever they&amp;#39;re available, then switch to Sayu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Sayu&amp;#39;s Burst (Q) before using her skill (E).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use Sayu&amp;#39;s Skill (E), make sure to HOLD the button for a second so she keeps rolling around after you let go of the button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use all your abilities whenever they&amp;#39;re up, and use Sayu&amp;#39;s skill (E) by HOLDING it, and then just keeping running her into the enemies to watch them die. Whenever Sayu&amp;#39;s skill (E) is not available, switch to Qiqi and just normal attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s about it. I was surprised how much easier this last day was to the others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=1413\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stage Two: Dosage Increase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bunch of dogs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly the enemy layout doesn&amp;#39;t matter because the trial characters in this day don&amp;#39;t really care what the enemies do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Comp: Kokomi + Diona&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) Gravity Potion - You do more damage maybe (not actually sure with how Kokomi works, but you don&amp;#39;t really care)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Resonance Potion - After Attacking with an infused normal attack, you gain up to 20% damage increase for all you care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combat Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kokomi&amp;#39;s artifacts make it so you do damage to enemies around you based on how much you heal (overhealing counts). So, stand close to enemies while you punch them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kokomi&amp;#39;s Skill (E) just lays down a jellyfish around you and heals you every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After using Kokomi&amp;#39;s Burst (Q), her normal attacks hit like a truck for about 7 seconds, so make sure you stay on her after bursting for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diona&amp;#39;s abilities don&amp;#39;t really matter but you can use her Burst (Q) before switching to Kokomi to help Kokomi freeze enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Diona&amp;#39;s Skill (E) whenever it&amp;#39;s available to get a shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use Diona&amp;#39;s abilities, then switch to Kokomi and use her Skill (E), then her Burst (Q), then just use Normal attacks for a while on her and rinse and repeat. Make sure you stand close to your enemies so her artifacts also do damage for you. Just punch everything until it&amp;#39;s all dead, enemy damage doesn&amp;#39;t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/gh1GKKBTegY?t=1542\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stage Three: Enhanced Sample&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Basically just do the same thing as before with Sayu&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Comp: Qiqi + Sayu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) Amp: Proactive Assault - You more damage when you&amp;#39;re above 80% HP (which is all the time).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Amp: Rousing Recovery - You do more damage after getting healed (which is all the time).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) Slow-Release Potion - Your Skills (E) regenerate your Bursts (Q) faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second verse, same as the first. Just roll around after spamming all your abilities and watch things die. Just don&amp;#39;t tap Sayu&amp;#39;s Skill (E) like me and you&amp;#39;ll clear way faster than I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1GKKBTegY\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stage One: Sublimation Verification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kill the two Shaman dudes when they spawn because they heal the big guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s really about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Comp: Kokomi + Diona&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) Amp: Rapid Recovery - Your healing is doubled (More damage for Kokomi&amp;#39;s Artifact set).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Explosive Potion - Kokomi does more damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) Amp: Rapid Assault - After you Sprint (Shift/Right Click), you attack faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just make sure to kill the two shamans that spawn (this will happen twice) ASAP to reduce how much the big guys get healed. Other than that, Potion 3 makes it so Kokomi turns into a machine gun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s about it. Collect Primos and go back to wondering why Spiral Abyss powercreep is so unfair or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For reference, out of the 11 characters available for trial, I own 6 of them (Beidou, Keqing, Chongyun, Qiqi, Sayu, and Diona). And out of those six, I really only am familiar with three of them or used them in Spiral (Beidou, Keqing, Chongyun).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or troubles when following my notes, feel free to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Basically, **someone can spend \"casual\" amounts of time in the game daily, but still engage in combat challenges at a high level of difficulty that would usually not pertain to a \"casual gamer\" of say Animal Crossing or Candy Crush**. \n\nBasically, a \"Casual\" who plays Animal Crossing, and Casual \"Genshin\" player, have very **different expectations placed on them**. You can just pop into a true Casual game like AC after a long time, forget all the game mechanics, and have fun, but you can't do that in Genshin, use a low level, purple artifact character from 1 year ago, and enjoy the combat encounters in Enkanomiya.\n\nYes, in terms of **daily game time demanded**, Genshin is a \"Casual\" game. \n\nBut here comes the misunderstanding, **just because the daily time demanded is low, does not mean the game as a whole should be dumbed-down and made excessively easy/devoid of challenge.** \n\nIt's merely **lenient in progression pacing**, allowing you to reach the higher difficulties at your own leisure. I would compare it to other action open world RPGs such as Zelda:BOTW, Ghost of Tsushima, Fenyx Rising. At the end of the day, Genshin has still been **designed by it's developers to be a self-respecting, full-fledged RPG that proudly touts its elemental combat system as it touts its well designed open world**. \n\nHowever, as compared to the games I mentioned above, since Genshin is a live-service game, we were at the **very beginning of the RPG, the beginner zone**, which is why everything in Monstadt and Liyue seemed low challenge and a cakewalk. **The same is probably the case for most normal difficulty RPGs; A difficulty progression that starts off easy and gets harder towards the end.** \n\nIf a newbie starts Genshin now, they will have the entirety of the easy Monstadt and Liyue arc to get used to the combat system, starting with weak bosses like Dvalin, graduating to more complex bosses like Azhdaha, then Inazuma comes and bosses like Raiden, and Signora start to get more difficult to test the player's skill. \n\nIn terms of the open world, they graduate from the little slimes and harmless hilichurls, to face the annoyances of enemies having more tricks up their sleeve like the rifthounds and new dragonlizard opponents with true damage and energy draining attacks.  \n\nUp till now, **the difficulty progression is standard fare for a normal RPG game**, for those who have never played RPG games. The game will only get **harder from here**, as the developers recognize that players should be getting more well-versed with its game mechanics and systems for them to up the ante and challenge, to prevent the game from feeling stale. Although there will still be a mix of **Ultra-easy events to be inclusive to new players**, there will also be harder events like the Amplifier ones, and perhaps the recent potions event, to cater to veterans. Even in the potions event, it is clear that they tried to be inclusive to newer players by giving free characters to use. \n\nHowever, **one should not mistake this inclusivity and past region's low difficulty** as that the game is **primarily designed and aimed at \"Casuals and Children\"** as I have seen many people claim on the reddit these days. **It's an RPG, and the 5-7 year journey of progression has just only begun**.",

I have had this internal discussion with some of the mods, and I think we are on a consensus that we have for some time now began seeing posts here that are blatantly non freak-outs or are agenda posts, or are blatant re-posts less than 4 weeks old.\n\nI think it is no secret within this community and sub that we all love that quality freak-outs are drowned out by content that does not simply belong here, or does not abide by our repost rules. I see this comment a lot in posts, by long time users of this sub that love the community for what it is - a place where we can laugh at, learn from and be horrified at freak-outs that happen around the world. \n\nThe main three rules of what make a freak-out are: \n\n**1) people freaking out or melting down \n\n2) losing their cool\n\n2) being weird in public**\n\nPosters that blatantly do post items that do not meet these any combination of these three criteria will see their posts removed and receive a temp ban. repeat offenders will see a perma ban enforced. We need to all do our part to keep this part of the reddit alive, and so far ya'll have been amazing and respectful. In truth, this policy has been enforced for some time by some mods, but going forward I would like to solidify it and make the community aware that this is what will happen. The aim is not an exodus but to help clean out the spam. \n\nIn addition, please use the report button to better help me and assuredly find posts that really should not be on the sub. We receive 80,000 unique visitors per hour, so obviously things to slip through the cracks at times. \n\nif you have any questions, drop a comment in this thread or message me.

    "content": "With the 12.12 update, AI across the board have seen major changes to everything from health pools, vision/detection, engagement range, movement, and accuracy.\n\n(For example, Sniper scavs on Customs have been seen hitting shots on players out to 300m)\n\nAI scavs now come in varying levels of difficulty &amp; health, and scav bosses and their guards have reached levels of cracked-out that even most major streamers like Lvndmark find fighting Gluhar and Killa to be more frustrating than it's worth.\n\nThis brings us to cultists. When cultists were first introduced, they would spawn in set locations at night, and hide in bushes &amp; trees, and upon walking too close, would try to stab you with a poisoned blade while making no noise. If you shot at them, or killed one, the rest of them would attack with highly accurate suppressed gunfire and you would likely die, unless you found hard cover. From there, it became a game of peeking and attacking from different angles to catch them outside of their sight lines, or by pushing close and killing them quickly, similar to pushing boss scavs.\n\nCultists were also initially visible on thermals, and were fairly trivial to dispatch at a distance over 150 meters. Within 150 meters, you could still be targeted after killing one, and they were extremely accurate up to that range.\n\nNow; cultists are near-invisible on thermals, can engage up to &amp; past 200 meters, have the same level of cracked-ness as boss scavs, spawn in a couple new locations, and will now shoot on sight. There are **MANY** documented cases of cultists who were not previously aggroed forgoing the poisoned blade and engaging in shoot-on-sight behavior.\n\nThe way you dealt with cultists in the past was through either bringing long range optics and abusing their AI/visibleness to farm them, or by staying away from their spawn areas and respecting them. Now, on maps such as Customs &amp; shoreline, simply walking within 200 meters of them will see you killed without provocation, in areas where you simply cannot see them with night vision, in a way where you wouldn't normally aggro a scav.\n\nExamples include:\n\n- Being lasered through the windows of Resort West wing, from the outside of East wing.\n\n- Being lasered in the construction/skeleton area of customs, from the stronghold/crackhouse area.\n\n- Being lasered at the swamp church on Shoreline, from the opposite end of the swamp.\n\nMy point here is: I want cultists to be challenging. They shouldn't be easy, and they *should* be feared. They're just currently broken ATM.\n\nBring the range back down to 150 meters, refine the aggro parameters so people trying to avoid them aren't instakilled 150 meters away, and fix the animation bugs PLEASE. They've been spinning in place for 2 wipes now, and they're currently being seen prone-spamming worse than normal scavs.\n\nPlease let me know what you think, if I missed something, or if you disagree.",

Just be crazy aggressive off spawn, go for contested areas, not wait for &amp;quot;the perfect shot&amp;quot;. And god damn it, I went 9/9 raids, completed 3 tasks, and in every single scav run died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if its Nikita just spying on my mentality or not but clearly I just need to drink some vodka and cheeki breeki hard bass my way through every raid now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "content": "I am an educated engineer in Geophysics and Space Technology. Through my education I've studied machine learning and statistics and done a lot of programming. I love Tarkov but absolutely hate the state its currently in with all the cheaters and the endless RMT cycle.\n\nI therefore request BSG send me all their player statistics (anonymized of course) and I will gladly take a shot at finding the cheaters battle eye missed and flag them along with RMT'ers, false positives, etc. \n\nThis is not a replacement for Battleye! It's purely meant as a second defense layer which passively detects cheaters out-of-raid purely based on their recorded behavior. \n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n**What i need**\n\nAll i need is a .csv file which goes something like: \n\"Player 31236170126, kills, deaths, game time, account value, hours played average x, average y, average z, etc.\"\nWith as many statistics as possible.\nI cant name the statistics i need here on reddit because cheaters could use them to try to evade bans hence x, y, z, and if the player is banned or not. \nThe data set MUST include previously banned players. \n\nBSG will likely need to record more statistics for each player but even just the stats they got currently would likely be sufficient to make a proof of concept anti cheat. \n_________________________________________________________________\n\n**How does it it work?**\n\nWell if you have a huge dataset for a bunch of people, lets just say a medical data set detailing random patients height, eye color, blood pressure, smoking habits, skin color, sexual orientation, gender, living location and if or not they have hearth disease.\n\nThen these random unrelated stats exist in an 8 dimensional vector space where people with and without a heart disease are grouped together. Some statistics might not provide much or any explanation for the data set. We could for example imagine sexual orientation doesnt mean much, while other like height can have a surprisingly high impact.\n\nYou might ask: \"If you already know does/doesn't have a heart disease then what the hell are you detecting??\" \n\nWell if the above mentioned hypothetical dataset has two distinct groups consisting of those who do and do not have a hearth disease then a new patient who we know all about except if they have the disease will appear in one of these clusters and we can therefore tell if or not they have it. \n\nTherefore we can detect cheaters purely on their behavior because they behave *much* differently than legitimate players by comparing them to known cheaters/legitimate players. \n\n_________________________________________________________________\n**Pros and cons**\n\nPros: \n\n* I can likely flag a high percentage of the current cheat population improving the detection rate marginally. \n  \n* It does not interfere with current anti-cheat or the game in any active way.\n\n* The data is completely anonymous.\n\n* It detects false positives providing the ability to flag an account as falsely banned and making the un ban process go smoother. \n\n* I will provide the first list of flagged accounts to BSG for free as a proof of concept, completely non-binding. It will literally cost them nothing but the time to send a data set or start recording more player stats. \n\n* This would merely flag accounts for investigation and should these also be flagged by battleye a ban would go through.\n\nCons: \n\n* BSG will need to take a bit of time to send me the data set  \n\n* The current data sets could be insufficient for accurate detection without further improvements to data logging.\n\n* Current data logging could need to be expanded to improve detection.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nIve already reached out to BSG through email but thought a post here would hurt for visibility. Again, if BSG likes the results we can figure out a reasonable price for my services in the future. For now I just wanna take a shot at getting rid of this plaque.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nEDIT 1: As this thread is going absolutely nuts with the responses ill answer some of the most relevant and frequently asked questions.\n\n**Q: Why do you think you are capable of choosing some arbitrary numbers that determine who cheats?**\n\nA: I dont. Machine learning relies on finding trends in N dimensional vector spaces and I dont have any influence on how a method finds cheaters. Literally out of my control. All I can do is chose a method to maximize precision.\n\n**Q: What the fuck does you degree have to do with coding, games and anti cheats?**\n\nA: Modern physics rely on machine learning to analyse massive data sets and find trends or fit physical models that are too advanced to manually figure out. You dont need any prior knowledge in a specific field to apply machine learning or data analysis. I've applied to numerous different data sets, among those medical data sets with hearth disease classification problem or for fitting spherical harmonic models to geomagnetic data. The field doesnt matter, the methods do. \n\n**Q: Are you a cheat developer trying to improve your cheats to be undetectable?**\n\nA: Even if that was the case the data sets I request here would provide zero value as they are anonymous and thus useless. There is no way for a player to access their own full statistics thus no way to compare yourself to the data set. Nor does a dataset alone provide any insight into what entries Battleye or BSG currently uses to find cheaters as variance varies greatly for different entries. \n\n**Q: You suck**\n\nA: Not a question but very likely. Its 2022 I can do what I want. \n\n**Q: Why dont you apply for a job you bum?**\n\nA: I already have a job. The only reason I want to do this is that I like Tarkov and want it to improve its anti cheat so I can enjoy it again. Its current state is off putting to me at least. \n\n**Q: Would you then just provide this service for free for ever?**\n\nA: Of course not. I will provide a proof of concept, BSG will be able to detect a few more cheaters and then that is that. Even if that means Tarkov will be more playable for 2 months its worth it in my eyes. \nNothing is free either. If BSG would want my services in the future Id need pay like any other normal person but so far Im not interested in a job as I already have one. \n\n**Q: What if it works? Is that it? Is it automatic?**\n\nA: If it works its easy to adjust but needs constant maintenance as the game changes. It would be unrealistic to think this is some sort of fire and forget solution. At best it would need to be update on a per wipe basis.",

I was excited to be a part of her wedding until I learned more and more. I was pregnant when she asked me to a part of her wedding. Since I have joined 5 people have dropped out due to her attitude and high expectations. Well Katie is upset because of everyone dropping out and the amount of people she has kicked out. She wants everyone to drop everything this year for her wedding. She kicked one personal attendant out for getting engaged. \n\nHere are a few of her expectations: \n1) No one is allowed to get pregnant from here on out \n2) No one is allowed to get engaged as this is \u201cher\u201d year and getting engaged would overshadow her wedding \n3) You must respond quickly and promptly and throughout the entire day\n4) Everything for the bride must be paid for by the bridesmaids on the bachelorette trip.\n5) You must buy new outfits (so that there are no photos of you in them already) for each night of the bachelorette trip (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday), bridal shower (2 days total), and rehearsal dinner PLUS different bridesmaids pajamas for each night of the bachelorette trip\n6) You must have your nails done professionally for each event \n7) You should already order all outfits for each event (wedding is in September) \n8) You must gift the bride at each event as well \n9) Bridesmaids must spend the night for bridal shower and night before the wedding\n\nThe rough estimate for everything she wants (bridal shower, air bnbs, bach trip, food &amp;amp; drink for myself and her, decorations for all events, outfits, etc) was around two grand on the low end. \n\nThere\u2019s so much more and I will add as I think of them at the bottom. \n\nNow, I completely understand this is her wedding and I was totally supportive of her and of all this shit until now. I\u2019m 2 weeks post partum and Katie came to take my baby\u2019s newborn pictures as I had hired her. When she came she insulted my weight multiple times and reminded me I need to lose my baby weight before her wedding (not that much weight?). She then proceeded to insult my infant daughter. She said it was sad she looked like my \u201chillbilly\u201d boyfriend and that her skin tone was reallyyyyyy dark implying it was a bad thing. My boyfriend is half native and when I told her that she backtracked really quickly on her comment. However, she began to make fun of my skin tone because I am a red head and quite pale. She keeps commenting on Facebook posts of my daughter about her looks and even since I\u2019ve blocked her from seeing those posts it still pisses me off. Anyways, my boyfriend thinks I\u2019m overreacting by wanting to drop out and quite frankly never speak to her again.\n\nETA: I know this seems fake but it really isn\u2019t, I\u2019m going to go take a screenshot of one of my many \u201ctasks\u201d off the groupchat on Snapchat and see if I can find y\u2019all some spicy messages[One SS](https://imgur.com/a/7PF4HVt)",

    "title": "AITA For not avoiding my best friend so his gf feels more comfortable?",
    "content": "I (f21) am best friends with W (m22). W and I met during freshman orientation and formed a tight knit group with 3 other girls. We are all still friends, but W and I hang out the most because we are the most social people in the group. \n\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way, I am a lesbian, and I am fully out of the closet. W has also never expressed any attraction to me before or after I came out. I\u2019ve always gotten along with his partners, and I\u2019m still close friends with one of his exes. I\u2019m also a very \u201chuggy\u201d person, I give incredible hugs and it\u2019s a skill that needs to be shared and appreciated lol.\n\nHe been dating S (f22) for 2 months now and he seems really happy about it. It had been rough for him during the pandemic, and I\u2019m happy that he found someone who lifts him up. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a little conflicted here.\n\nI was excited to meet S after W talking about her nonstop and we + a couple of other friends met at his place (we are all vaccinated and tested negative). She didn\u2019t seem to like me very much, answering all my questions with one or two word responses and giving my kinda cold looks. I tend to overthink, so I figured she was just shy and I was reading too much into things. We all ended up playing Mario Kart and Smash for a few hours. When it was time to go I hugged W and all my other friends goodbye, I nonverbally offered her a hug but she just shook her head (fair enough, honestly). \n\nThe next day I got a dm from her on Instagram telling me she didn\u2019t appreciate how flirty I was with W and told me to \u201cback the fuck off\u201d. I was pretty shocked, because I thought she knew I was gay, but I could kinda see where she was coming from. I\u2019m very fem presenting so people might often assume incorrectly. I clarified that I am not interested in W or any man for that matter, and I have no intention of getting between them. She said that didn\u2019t matter and I need to \u201cknow my role\u201d. Which was\u2026.interesting. Trying to keep the peace, I told her I\u2019d stop giving him hugs if that was the issue. Which she then replied that she\u2019d prefer I just distance myself from him.

    "content_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (f21) am best friends with W (m22). W and I met during freshman orientation and formed a tight knit group with 3 other girls. We are all still friends, but W and I hang out the most because we are the most social people in the group. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s get this out of the way, I am a lesbian, and I am fully out of the closet. W has also never expressed any attraction to me before or after I came out. I\u2019ve always gotten along with his partners, and I\u2019m still close friends with one of his exes. I\u2019m also a very \u201chuggy\u201d person, I give incredible hugs and it\u2019s a skill that needs to be shared and appreciated lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He been dating S (f22) for 2 months now and he seems really happy about it. It had been rough for him during the pandemic, and I\u2019m happy that he found someone who lifts him up. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a little conflicted here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was excited to meet S after W talking about her nonstop and we + a couple of other friends met at his place (we are all vaccinated and tested negative). She didn\u2019t seem to like me very much, answering all my questions with one or two word responses and giving my kinda cold looks. I tend to overthink, so I figured she was just shy and I was reading too much into things. We all ended up playing Mario Kart and Smash for a few hours. When it was time to go I hugged W and all my other friends goodbye, I nonverbally offered her a hug but she just shook her head (fair enough, honestly). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I got a dm from her on Instagram telling me she didn\u2019t appreciate how flirty I was with W and told me to \u201cback the fuck off\u201d. I was pretty shocked, because I thought she knew I was gay, but I could kinda see where she was coming from. I\u2019m very fem presenting so people might often assume incorrectly. I clarified that I am not interested in W or any man for that matter, and I have no intention of getting between them. She said that didn\u2019t matter and I need to \u201cknow my role\u201d. Which was\u2026.interesting. Trying to keep the peace, I told her I\u2019d stop giving him hugs if that was the issue. Which she then replied that she\u2019d prefer I just distance myself from him. I haven\u2019t responded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really have no intention of avoiding or distancing myself from one of my best friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA, is this disrespectful to their relationship?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: I slept on it and I sent screenshots of the convo to W with the message \u201chey homie, I totally understand if you want to focus on your relationship right now.

Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in.

I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.\n\nI said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.\n\nWhen we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.\n\nI just wanted to spend time with my friends, 1 on 1. AITA?\n\nEDIT: clarification.\n\n1) I mentioned Jane's gender because usually on posts like these, the no partner rule is because the partners are of opposite sex so it's a 'safe space' for the people to talk (guys night or girls night). I brought up that she's a woman because all my friends have male partners but it's still a no-partner's night despite the gender.\n\n2) I am female. Jane is female. I am bi. Jane is lesbian. \n\n3) All my friends are female\n\n4) the party was a birthday celebration which is why it was over 2 days. They usually aren't that long",

When my brother\u2019s children (who visit only a few times a year) visit, they interpret for her, or Walter and I have to constantly be looking over their shoulders to help resolve their miscommunications, which is too helicopter parent for me. \n\nWhen we learned Cora was deaf, Emily pestered me about getting her an implant and continues to send me shame-y Facebook posts about the benefits of the implant and those videos of babies hearing for the first time. She constantly says it\u2019s \u201cbetter than having to learn two languages.\u201d She\u2019s been very pushy about it, to the point she and Walter got in a heated argument over it. Since then, she has not pestered him about it, only me.\n\nMy last straw was this past weekend. Emily was with all her kids, teaching them a game.

I told her that my daughter can communicate, just not how Emily wants, and said that I won\u2019t have my daughter excluded for something so petty.

We got in a spat about it, so my family left. Emily has not had contact since.

I do try and give him privacy and mostly stay in my classroom or the staff room though. He (sadly haha) does not take art but his girlfriend does. I actually did not know she was his girlfriend until I overheard her and a few other kids talking about my son.\n\nI jokingly asked Max later if he had any admirers and that was when he told me about his girlfriend. I understand why he was hesitant because I\u2019m an older white lady (my parents aren\u2019t very open minded either) and his girlfriend is of South Asian descent and her family\u2019s muslim but I assured him that I wasn\u2019t like that at all.\n\nWell, the other day, Max asked me if his girlfriend could come over and I said sure. I told my husband that she was coming over but didn\u2019t say anything else except \u201clook presentable\u201d. Well, when she arrived there was an obvious drop in my husband\u2019s mood/behaviour.

Im in my early 30\u2019s so I get it, but it\u2019s getting obnoxious. For the most part I just keep my opinion to myself but my close friends know I\u2019m militantly child-free so my not giving a flying monkey about their babies shouldn\u2019t be a surprise.\n\nAnyways onto the issue, my closest friend got pregnant in the summer and I was devastated.  I kind of thought she was in the same boat as me but obviously not. I\u2019ll admit I reacted a bit poorly when she told me but it was literally months ago.

I told her to just talk about other stuff. Like it shouldn\u2019t be that hard. She\u2019s still a person outside of being a spawn incubator right? \n\nWe argued a bit and she pretty much told me she isn\u2019t in the physical or mental headspace to tiptoe around the fact she\u2019s pregnant with me which I literally never asked her to do and she brought up again me mentioning abort**** (mostly jokingly and in reference to me - I was like \u201cOh geez I\u2019d already be at an abort*** clinic\u201d) months ago and said she just couldn\u2019t handle the \u201cnegativity\u201d right now. \n\nI told her she wasn\u2019t doing anyone favours turning into a mommybot and to hit me up when she has a personality again which yeah was maybe a bit harsh but she literally was saying to me we couldn\u2019t hang out because she couldn\u2019t not talk about being pregnant, it seems harsh, but her own words pretty much.\n\nI vented to some of our mutual friends about it and the reactions are split. Some say she\u2019s overreacting and some have talked to her recently and not had it not be about pregnancy anyways so they don\u2019t get her reasoning  and others say I\u2019m a huge asshole because she\u2019s having major complications so it\u2019s probably hard to just \u201cturn off.\u201d Arguably though today was the first I\u2019d heard of any complications so how would I have known?

Im in my early 30\u2019s so I get it, but it\u2019s getting obnoxious. For the most part I just keep my opinion to myself but my close friends know I\u2019m militantly child-free so my not giving a flying monkey about their babies shouldn\u2019t be a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways onto the issue, my closest friend got pregnant in the summer and I was devastated.  I kind of thought she was in the same boat as me but obviously not. I\u2019ll admit I reacted a bit poorly when she told me but it was literally months ago. I noticed yesterday we hadn\u2019t talked or hung out in like 4 months (not extremely unusual cuz we both get busy) so I asked her if we could go to a restaurant and catch up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said she was dealing with some major health stuff right now so she isn\u2019t going out at the moment, cool I understand that, so I asked if maybe I could come over for tea or something and she was super dismissive like \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the best time for me for awhile.\u201d So I straight up just asked her if something was up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She told me she didn\u2019t really want to hang out right now because she knows I don\u2019t want to hear about any baby stuff.

    "content": "I (26F) have just returned home from attending a close friend's (27,F) wedding. Most of the wedding ceremonies turned out to be a shitshow because my friend turned into a bridezilla. 7 people from the brides party were planning to drop out of the final ceremony because she rejected our outfits at the last minute &amp; wanted us to wear old looking awful outfits that she had got for us. I posted about all of that here but my post got removed because of some issue with my response to the judgment bot. Eventually we decided to attend the wedding to not cause any drama.\n\nOn the day of the reception, i was talking to a couple of people including the groom(34,M), who i dont know very well. We were standing in an area that was away from the main hall &amp; was partially obscured by some decor.He started talking about how i had never hung out with him one on one before, which was weird cus i only knew him as my friends fiance. i laughed it off but he kept going on about it. i steered the convo towards their honeymoon when he said \" bet you wish it was you who was going with me, right\", i didnt reply cus i thought i misheard him. He kept repeating it though and he started saying how if i was his bride he wouldnt be able to control himself rn &amp; that we would have been doing it right here.\n\nI didnt know how to respond so i said WTF &amp; started walking away when he grabbed me arm &amp; said \"lets get out of here, we can be done in 30 mins and no one will miss us\" to which i responded no i will not. He still didnt let go of me &amp; kept saying i know you want to.\n\nOne of my friend Emma had overheard everything &amp; she intervened with her bf at this point. the groom started panicking &amp; said i was too drunk &amp; being inappropriate. My friend knows i havent been drinking at all that day so he got pissed at the groom, all this caught the attention of the bride too, who came over &amp; asked her hubby who repeated the same explanation again. The bride started screaming at me for trying to sabotage her day  so i told her exactly  what her precious husband had said to me with Emma backing up everything. Unbeknownst to us the brides screaming had attracted everyone to the spot &amp; they had heard everything. My back was towards the main hall so i had no idea. i left with some friends right away. \n\nAccording to the brides sister a lot of people believe me &amp; a massive chunk of them left soon after, the bride cried &amp; the groom got drunk. BTW the groom was sober throughout the whole incident. The bride has sent me a lengthy text saying that I should have kept it quiet &amp; talked about it later on &amp; that shes cutting of contact with me as im trying to destroy her marriage. \n\nSome other people in the party have said the same too so idk.

Most of the wedding ceremonies turned out to be a shitshow because my friend turned into a bridezilla. 7 people from the brides party were planning to drop out of the final ceremony because she rejected our outfits at the last minute &amp;amp; wanted us to wear old looking awful outfits that she had got for us. I posted about all of that here but my post got removed because of some issue with my response to the judgment bot. Eventually we decided to attend the wedding to not cause any drama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the day of the reception, i was talking to a couple of people including the groom(34,M), who i dont know very well. We were standing in an area that was away from the main hall &amp;amp; was partially obscured by some decor.He started talking about how i had never hung out with him one on one before, which was weird cus i only knew him as my friends fiance. i laughed it off but he kept going on about it. i steered the convo towards their honeymoon when he said &amp;quot; bet you wish it was you who was going with me, right&amp;quot;, i didnt reply cus i thought i misheard him. He kept repeating it though and he started saying how if i was his bride he wouldnt be able to control himself rn &amp;amp; that we would have been doing it right here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didnt know how to respond so i said WTF &amp;amp; started walking away when he grabbed me arm &amp;amp; said &amp;quot;lets get out of here, we can be done in 30 mins and no one will miss us&amp;quot; to which i responded no i will not. He still didnt let go of me &amp;amp; kept saying i know you want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my friend Emma had overheard everything &amp;amp; she intervened with her bf at this point. the groom started panicking &amp;amp; said i was too drunk &amp;amp; being inappropriate. My friend knows i havent been drinking at all that day so he got pissed at the groom, all this caught the attention of the bride too, who came over &amp;amp; asked her hubby who repeated the same explanation again. The bride started screaming at me for trying to sabotage her day  so i told her exactly  what her precious husband had said to me with Emma backing up everything. Unbeknownst to us the brides screaming had attracted everyone to the spot &amp;amp; they had heard everything. My back was towards the main hall so i had no idea. i left with some friends right away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to the brides sister a lot of people believe me &amp;amp; a massive chunk of them left soon after, the bride cried &amp;amp; the groom got drunk. BTW the groom was sober throughout the whole incident. The bride has sent me a lengthy text saying that I should have kept it quiet &amp;amp; talked about it later on &amp;amp; that shes cutting of contact with me as im trying to destroy her marriage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some other people in the party have said the same too so idk. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

First thing I gave my mom a giant hug like my little sister does and said sorry and she forgave me. Then I had a big talk with mom and dad about Elissa. The first thing my mom asked was if Elissa wanted to meet her. She seemed sad when I told her that Elissa threatened to cut me off if I'd ever try to make them meet. Then it got to what I wanted from Elissa and I said I just wanted to be her sister to get to know her and be friends in real life and not just on the phone. I did admit that I wanted to go to pursue the field I told them of at UofTcause of her. I could tell my mom was getting a bit mad but dad pointed out Elissa is really successful a good role model and a good mentor and to deny me her would only hurt my future so I had their permission.\n\nMy mom did bring up the points that you guys did like what if I graduate or get married and stuff. I admitted that I didn't know but I'd find stuff that made it better or find different ways. I guess that hurt my mom so she said it's we'll deal when it happens but that she can work on her pain for me and if Elissa loves me she will too. I did have to promise not to tell my siblings (wasn't going to anyway) about Elissa.\n\nNext time I talked to Elissa I told her that my mom found out we were talking and told her the whole mess that happened. She said she was glad that we could keep talking and it meant a lot to her that I want to be her sister. I told her what my mom said about me getting married and she said they'd find a way and joked that she could just put on a balaclava mask for all events to avoid being seen.\n\nWell on Christmas Elissa FaceTimedd and showed me a really pretty ring her boyfriend got her and said she was getting married and my present was tickets to see her in Spring Break and an invite to her wedding stuff in the summer. She did say if my mom said I couldn't go she'd understand. I talked with mom and dad and I can go as long as I can take my older cousin with me (he's 25 and has known all this for years) and according to Elissa I can. She wants me to have a role in her wedding! Hopefully things aren't bad in march and I can go to Toronto.\n\nHonestly since then its all been great. I talk with Elissa a lot more she's gotten me into a game called Age of Empires, she's helped me with my chemistry homework, mom's been going to therapy about her and started training me in tennis. And on Friday I got the invite card to her wedding and it was written for me as: to my sweet little sister! (have to hide it from my siblings tho)\n\nSo I guess that's me using my one update to tell you guys that I think its a happy ending.",

Nobody really cooks for everyone, we mostly cook for ourselves as me and my brother both work nights, so it's rare we're all together during dinner.\n\nThe problem that's been happening lately (getting worse lately) is that my dad doesn't want to share snacks with me and my brother. He gets really mad at me whenever I grab chips, eat a granola bar, eat any pastries he buys (he'll buy like 12 cinnamon buns and I can't have any), etc. I get not wanting to share snacks, so we came up with a compromise. Any junk food that is on the counter or in the pantry is fair game, and anything in a specific cupboard, in our own rooms, or left labelled in the fridge is off limits. This worked ok for a while, and I started buying my own junk food to keep in my room (honestly I was eating less of \"his\" food than before). Then I started noticing that the food in my room was going missing, I asked if anyone ate it and my dad said he did, because I \"owed\" him. I asked him to stop and he kinda waved it off.\n\nEventually this shifted into him getting upset with me if I didn't buy him anything from the store/any fast food places I went; despite him never asking for anything before I went, only after I got back. It got pretty annoying so I talked to my mom (I did try to talk to my dad but he kept waving me off and saying it wasn't a big deal), and she talked to him and he stopped for awhile.\n\nOnce he started bugging me again about the food, I asked him again what his problem was, because at this point I'm not even eating his food! I rarely even go into the kitchen because I don't want to worry about him popping around a corner watching me to make sure I don't grab any of his food. He got angry and accused me of constantly stealing his stuff, so this was \"payback\" and I \"owed\" him. My dad has always been weirdly protective of his food, but at this point he's getting protective over *my* food. So now he's basically accusing me of not sharing, and yet expecting him to. Pointing out that he has space to put his own food doesn't matter.\n\nToday, he ate the pizza I had sitting in the fridge for my lunch for work. Me and my brother both had pizza in the fridge so I wrote my name on the bag. I saw him eating it right as I went to grab it and head out for my shift. I basically blew up on him, asked why he would do that when *it literally had my name on it* and asked what the point of splitting food was if he just didn't care. Once again, all he said was that I \"owed\" him, and *I should learn to share*. At this point I was pissed and had to go to work so I left.\n\nThe \"owing him\" thing is apparently because he clothed/fed/kept a roof over my head while I was growing up.

    "content": "Hi all,\n\ni don't even know why im writing this as i am not really comfortable with the whole situation.  But i think it woud be good to get another opionen on this matter, it's a little complicated so please hear me out.\n\nI live in Germany.\n\nMy (M26) Grandpa died a 2 months ago. My Dad inherited every thing which included 3 relativly large properties with houses on them (they belonged to my grandma and her sister which didn't had any children)\n\nMy Mum and my Dad are thankfully in good health, but they planed for the future and wrote their will last week. After that they sat me and my sistster(F24, let's call her Sarah) down and told us how the plan to divide theire belongings in case something happens. \n\nA little background to my sister, she has a longtime boyfriend (M25) let's call him Jim. They've been toegether for about 6-7 years i think. The problem is that both are really bad with money. They switch cars so much that they often take a loss when they are sold again. Only last year the bought 2 cars and made about 10.000 \u20ac minus. I've lend them money on multiple cases sometimes small sometimes large sums. She still owes me around 6.500 \u20ac and she is slowly paying it back, but they are constantly living above their income. Sarah pays for everything.\n\nJim and Sarah are currently living with my parents in a flat and they pay a very small amount of rent.  \nJim wants to build or buy a house in his hometown which is 15 minutes away. Spoiler they can't afford it.\n\nNow the the important part. My Parents want to give most of the inheritance to me. My Sister would only get the flat they are currently living in but i would get the property and the house and all the stuff of my grandparents and she is pissed.

    "content_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i don&amp;#39;t even know why im writing this as i am not really comfortable with the whole situation.  But i think it woud be good to get another opionen on this matter, it&amp;#39;s a little complicated so please hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I live in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My (M26) Grandpa died a 2 months ago. My Dad inherited every thing which included 3 relativly large properties with houses on them (they belonged to my grandma and her sister which didn&amp;#39;t had any children)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Mum and my Dad are thankfully in good health, but they planed for the future and wrote their will last week. After that they sat me and my sistster(F24, let&amp;#39;s call her Sarah) down and told us how the plan to divide theire belongings in case something happens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little background to my sister, she has a longtime boyfriend (M25) let&amp;#39;s call him Jim. They&amp;#39;ve been toegether for about 6-7 years i think. The problem is that both are really bad with money. They switch cars so much that they often take a loss when they are sold again. Only last year the bought 2 cars and made about 10.000 \u20ac minus. I&amp;#39;ve lend them money on multiple cases sometimes small sometimes large sums. She still owes me around 6.500 \u20ac and she is slowly paying it back, but they are constantly living above their income. Sarah pays for everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jim and Sarah are currently living with my parents in a flat and they pay a very small amount of rent.&lt;br/&gt;\nJim wants to build or buy a house in his hometown which is 15 minutes away. Spoiler they can&amp;#39;t afford it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the the important part. My Parents want to give most of the inheritance to me. My Sister would only get the flat they are currently living in but i would get the property and the house and all the stuff of my grandparents and she is pissed. Also there is a clause that she can only sell it to me. My parents fear that Sarah will sell everything to sponsor her boyfriends dreams.

    "content": "New account. Obvious reason.\n\nMarried w/ 3 Adult kids. All employed and moved out. Six months ago, 24-year-old single Daughter asked to move back home for a year to help save for an apartment. We agreed, and charged her only a small rent (that I planned to give back if she met her savings goals).\n\nThis past summer, wife and I went on a vacation and daughter, without our knowledge, held a party at the house. Upon return, we noted items in the house damaged or missing. Daughter admitted to what happened and committed to pay for damaged/stolen items.\n\nI was upset and felt the privacy and sanctity of 'my castle' was violated. It made me sick to my stomach that strangers I didn't know were in my house and pilfered through my stuff. I got over it and we moved on. However, I made it very clear to my daughter that NO VISITORS were allowed in our house in the future unless we were present and/or approved in advance.\n\nFast Forward to the Holidays. After Christmas, wife and I went on a 3-day getaway.\n\nPrior to leaving, I installed a wireless 'nanny-cam' device in the living room that is hooked up to the internet. I did it on my own without advising my wife and daughter - Kind of like a 'Trust-but-Verify' situation.\n\nAfter a day, I logged into the camera about 9:00 PM and although there wasn't a party going on, my daughter had a guy in the house engaging in an activity I can't unsee. I quickly turned the computer off and told my wife....and then SHTF.\n\nShe accused me of violating my daughter's trust and dignity. She immediately called my daughter and advised that I was 'spying' on her - and our mini-getaway devolved into a series of mean-spirited comments and silent treatment. Upon our return home, daughter was in the process of moving out, and without getting into specifics, I'm apparently the equivalent of pond scum.\n\nIn my defense, what I saw for all of 5 seconds was not expected on my part. Daughter wasn't in a relationship or even dating. Further, she violated my explicit rule of not having guests over....and there was only a single camera that covered the living room - not an area where there is normally an expectation of privacy.\n\nAlthough it's embarrassing all around, I don't think ITA. I believe I was within my rights to protect and surveille my house in the manner that I did. Wife's position is that I had no right to put a camera in the living room without her knowledge, and daughter's position is that if she knew about the camera, she wouldn\u2019t have invited anyone over, but nevertheless believes she did nothing wrong, as she was a rent-paying adult, and was entitled to have a single person over, and what I did was a gross invasion of her privacy.\n\nFor the record...I didn't pass judgment. Daughter is a mature adult and could have engaged in whatever legal activity she chose - Just not in my house involving another person.\n\nSo here I am just over a week later, looking for the opinion of strangers on the internet? AITA?\n\nEDIT - A few comments:\n\n1. Why didn't I tell my wife in advance? I guess I wanted to do an integrity check on my daughter. The summer-time theft incident really shook me, as I had some silver medallions stolen from my desk that had belonged to my father. Very sentimental items. My daughter's take was that 'they were just things'. It really took me an effort to get over it, but I did. I really wanted to know if my Adult Daughter was someone I could implicitly trust.... and my concern was that my wife would tell her about the camera/test.\n2. Some comments were made along the lines of \"What if your daughter walked past naked whilst doing the laundry\"? Honestly, the thought NEVER crossed my mind. We're a family that, for whatever reason, never walked around even half-naked. It just wasn't a thing.\n3. The 'rent' was $200/month all-in, compared to $1,000/month plus utilities and parking that she was paying. A small amount, just on principle, that, as mentioned, I planned to give her back to help with her down payment for a small Condo. Verbal agreement only.\n4. If she had advised that she wanted to invite a single friend over, I wouldn't have had an issue if I'd known the person. My issues were strangers.....as this visitor clearly was.\n\nAs far as what I got out of this exercise?\n\nAbout a 50/50 ruling. Which gives me some comfort in that I'm not some horrible Dr Evil as was suggested in the immediate aftermath.\n\nIf I had a do-over, I would, as some commenters suggested, set the cameras up pointing towards the exterior doors. I would have needed 3, but that would have removed the 'privacy' question from the debate.\n\nI will apologize to my wife and daughter to the extent that, although my motive was pure, my execution could have been refined. However, my daughter and I will still have some work to do on our relationship. She violated my trust.....\n\nAnd....when tempers cool down, I'll suggest that my daughter pay to re-upholstery the sofa.\n\n(I'm kidding.)\n\n(To soon?)\n\nFINAL EDIT - \n\n1. My daughter - whom I still love very much, is currently living with a friend but most of her stuff is still here. It's a tossup what the future holds as far as her living situation. Just as I have softened my position with hindsight, so, I believe, has she. However we still think each other is an AH to some extent - just not as much as one as the moment when the incident occurred.....and we just scheduled a weekend hiking/camping trip with her and her sister, so our relationship will be fine.\n2. Some commenters stated that it was unreasonable she couldn't bring a guest over as a 'rent paying tenant'. That is the hill that I will die on. Her 'rent' hardly even covered the cost of food, and she knew damn well she was likely going to get it back....My wife and I have been very, very generous with our adult children...... After the summertime damages and thefts (which were reported to the police in case the items were pawned), I made it clear that she can have guests, but ONLY if I know who they are in advance, or I am present or agree in advance. NO MORE STRANGERS IN MY HOUSE...(as an aside the party had about 30 people...and some were friends of friends. I was appalled when the full details were finally known...There's lots more to that story!)\n3.  If she wanted a 'Tinder Hook-Up' (I get it, but still...gross), that's what Holiday-Inn Express is for. She has a job and isn't destitute....important to note that she agreed fully at the time, only to argue a different case in the immediate aftermath.\n4. My Wife - Again, with a do-over, I might have been more strategic with my 'discovery' and utilized the info differently, as the SHTF as soon as I told her what I saw. It was very visceral and raw. However, we have a deep bond after 35 years, and have weathered greater storms than this.....at least with all the info out immediately after it happened, there wasn't an opportunity for a bald-faced lie to be made to me, which, in my opinion and based on my personality, would have been much worse all around. \n5. All evidence has been erased and/or destroyed.\n\nI never could have imagined I would have a situation interesting enough to seek outside, anonymous advice from strangers on the internet. Thank you all for taking the time to weigh-in..... except for those that called me a dirty old pervert. Really? That was your take away?\n\nI'm going to share this thread with my wife and daughter so they can understand there is far more gray than black and white. Some of you shared great wisdom that I truly appreciate. \n\nNow, back to being a lurker and judging other people. .... Way more fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Upon our return home, daughter was in the process of moving out, and without getting into specifics, I&amp;#39;m apparently the equivalent of pond scum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my defense, what I saw for all of 5 seconds was not expected on my part. Daughter wasn&amp;#39;t in a relationship or even dating. Further, she violated my explicit rule of not having guests over....and there was only a single camera that covered the living room - not an area where there is normally an expectation of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;#39;s embarrassing all around, I don&amp;#39;t think ITA. I believe I was within my rights to protect and surveille my house in the manner that I did. Wife&amp;#39;s position is that I had no right to put a camera in the living room without her knowledge, and daughter&amp;#39;s position is that if she knew about the camera, she wouldn\u2019t have invited anyone over, but nevertheless believes she did nothing wrong, as she was a rent-paying adult, and was entitled to have a single person over, and what I did was a gross invasion of her privacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the record...I didn&amp;#39;t pass judgment. Daughter is a mature adult and could have engaged in whatever legal activity she chose - Just not in my house involving another person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here I am just over a week later, looking for the opinion of strangers on the internet? AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT - A few comments:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Why didn&amp;#39;t I tell my wife in advance? I guess I wanted to do an integrity check on my daughter. The summer-time theft incident really shook me, as I had some silver medallions stolen from my desk that had belonged to my father. Very sentimental items. My daughter&amp;#39;s take was that &amp;#39;they were just things&amp;#39;. It really took me an effort to get over it, but I did. I really wanted to know if my Adult Daughter was someone I could implicitly trust.... and my concern was that my wife would tell her about the camera/test.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some comments were made along the lines of &amp;quot;What if your daughter walked past naked whilst doing the laundry&amp;quot;? Honestly, the thought NEVER crossed my mind. We&amp;#39;re a family that, for whatever reason, never walked around even half-naked. It just wasn&amp;#39;t a thing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#39;rent&amp;#39; was $200/month all-in, compared to $1,000/month plus utilities and parking that she was paying. A small amount, just on principle, that, as mentioned, I planned to give her back to help with her down payment for a small Condo. Verbal agreement only.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If she had advised that she wanted to invite a single friend over, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had an issue if I&amp;#39;d known the person. My issues were strangers.....as this visitor clearly was.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as what I got out of this exercise?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a 50/50 ruling. Which gives me some comfort in that I&amp;#39;m not some horrible Dr Evil as was suggested in the immediate aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I had a do-over, I would, as some commenters suggested, set the cameras up pointing towards the exterior doors. I would have needed 3, but that would have removed the &amp;#39;privacy&amp;#39; question from the debate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will apologize to my wife and daughter to the extent that, although my motive was pure, my execution could have been refined. However, my daughter and I will still have some work to do on our relationship. She violated my trust.....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And....when tempers cool down, I&amp;#39;ll suggest that my daughter pay to re-upholstery the sofa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;m kidding.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(To soon?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FINAL EDIT - &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My daughter - whom I still love very much, is currently living with a friend but most of her stuff is still here. It&amp;#39;s a tossup what the future holds as far as her living situation. Just as I have softened my position with hindsight, so, I believe, has she. However we still think each other is an AH to some extent - just not as much as one as the moment when the incident occurred.....and we just scheduled a weekend hiking/camping trip with her and her sister, so our relationship will be fine.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some commenters stated that it was unreasonable she couldn&amp;#39;t bring a guest over as a &amp;#39;rent paying tenant&amp;#39;. That is the hill that I will die on. Her &amp;#39;rent&amp;#39; hardly even covered the cost of food, and she knew damn well she was likely going to get it back....My wife and I have been very, very generous with our adult children...... After the summertime damages and thefts (which were reported to the police in case the items were pawned), I made it clear that she can have guests, but ONLY if I know who they are in advance, or I am present or agree in advance. NO MORE STRANGERS IN MY HOUSE...(as an aside the party had about 30 people...and some were friends of friends. I was appalled when the full details were finally known...There&amp;#39;s lots more to that story!)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; If she wanted a &amp;#39;Tinder Hook-Up&amp;#39; (I get it, but still...gross), that&amp;#39;s what Holiday-Inn Express is for. She has a job and isn&amp;#39;t destitute....important to note that she agreed fully at the time, only to argue a different case in the immediate aftermath.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My Wife - Again, with a do-over, I might have been more strategic with my &amp;#39;discovery&amp;#39; and utilized the info differently, as the SHTF as soon as I told her what I saw. It was very visceral and raw. However, we have a deep bond after 35 years, and have weathered greater storms than this.....at least with all the info out immediately after it happened, there wasn&amp;#39;t an opportunity for a bald-faced lie to be made to me, which, in my opinion and based on my personality, would have been much worse all around. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All evidence has been erased and/or destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never could have imagined I would have a situation interesting enough to seek outside, anonymous advice from strangers on the internet. Thank you all for taking the time to weigh-in..... except for those that called me a dirty old pervert. Really? That was your take away?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to share this thread with my wife and daughter so they can understand there is far more gray than black and white. Some of you shared great wisdom that I truly appreciate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, back to being a lurker and judging other people. .... Way more fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My oldest brother (51) has a mental disorder. He can can eat and care for himself physically but cannot work or refuses to, and cannot be left unsupervised. He was not born this way, but rather developed it in his early 20s. \n\nI was never close to him growing up. I felt he used his condition to his advantage and to gain sympathy from everyone. I had a feeling my dad felt the same way. They used to fight a lot about my brother being lazy and not pulling his fair share even before he developed the condition.  I have always blamed my brother for causing unnecessary stress to my dad while he was battling cancer up to his eventual death. After he died, I got a part time job to help the family, while going to high school. Meanwhile, my brother has never held a job in his life.  \n\nI have made it clear to both my mother and sister that I refuse to be his caretaker when my mom passes. I have offered to provide some help financially, but I do not want him in my house for the rest of his life, or mine. I feel no emotional attachment to him. In fact, dare I say, he feels like a stranger to me.\n\nMy mom almost died last year and spent several months in a rehab facility.

My wife was happy to help last year, but did state she would not be ok with this being a permanent arrangement. Frankly, I can\u2019t say I blame her for that. \n\nUltimately, I feel it is my mother\u2019s responsibility to make future arrangements for her son\u2019s well being and not just assume we will handle it. I have sat down with her and offered to pay for legal fees or whatever is needed, as long as she makes the arrangements. Months have gone by, and she just sweeps the topic under the rug. Even if my sister offered to split the caretaking duties and time, I just don\u2019t want any part of it at all. They both think with time I will come around, but I am not.\n\nEDIT: for many asking, he does have a diagnosis of schizophrenia and is on medication.

I do own a tablet for taking notes at school but the camera is broken since it fell off of a table once. We do own an old and broken family laptop but honestly it can't be used anymore.\n\nWe are not allowed to print the exam so we have to view it at a screen. Our camera has to show us and the paper we're writing on. Yesterday my (new) professor told me to turn of my computer since I could use it for cheating and use a laptop instead. I explained the situation to him but he insisted that the computer needs to be turned off. I offered to turn off my other screens or put them away and make the camera show my screens. He wasn't satisfied with it and he started getting louder and even paused the exams for all students. I felt bad for the others so I just did what he said (turn off the computer) and therefore left the zoom meeting. I knew failing would only lower my grade by 1 so I didn't care about that.\n\nHowever the prof called my guardians and told them how disrespectfull I am (I couldn't hear the rest so idk what else he said.) My family screamed at me for being so disrespecting to authority and so on. They took away ALL my devices - even the ones I need for school and work. I'm extremly sad and upset that they are so angry with me. Especially bc I'm usually a well-behaved student so I don't know why that one incident riled them up so much.\n\nSo AITA?

I never told her I was gay because I don't know what my sexuality is but I'm content with not labeling myself atm.\n\nAnyways, the issue started after that. Anytime she and I were out together she would tell people (both strangers and old friends) that I'm gay. Any time I talked to a guy at a club, bar, party, etc. she would tell him that I'm gay. We meet up with old friends and she'll somehow manage to force it into the conversation. One time in a bar we met this group of guys who were pretty chill and they invited us to sit with them. They were really friendly and one of the guys and I hit it off talking about books. When I left to get us some drinks I came back and his entire demeanour had changed and he was suddenly very apologetic. He said if he had realised I was gay he wouldn't have come on so strong. I asked him why he thought I was gay and he informed that when I left my friend had sat beside him \"just to let him know\" that I was gay. I immediately pulled her aside and asked her why she thought that it was okay outing me to people when I've never even come out to her and then she switched up and got really defensive, saying it wasn't fair that I was leading that guy on when I wasn't interested, getting his hopes up for no reason, etc. But this was almost every guy I talked to in public she did this with. Even if it was just a friendly conversation she would still tell them.\n\nI was really angry this time and we had a small fight and I called her a lot of names, mostly for assuming my sexuality and for repeatedly outing me to strangers. I mean for all she knew they could have been homophobic and she could have put me in a potential danger as we live in a pretty conversative town. Not to mention that I haven't even come out to my family. She got upset that I called her names (I'll admit I shouldn't have) and called me the AH for lying about my sexuality in the first place and that she was just looking out for me. I never corrected her assumption that I was gay because I always just thought it was easier than having to come out again despite never actually coming out to her in the first place. Coming out is nerve-wracking and I didn't wanna go through it again.\n\nIt's been just over a week and we haven't spoken since I left early that night. I haven't been able to talk to anybody about or get another perspective because I'm still technically in the closet but it's been eating away at me.

    "content": "The fed has fucked up.  Inflation wasn't transitory and their favorite measure, core PCE, is the highest it's been in 4 decades.\n\nNow they have to look like they are fighting inflation by raising rates and tapering asset purchases.  They are talking quite a big game right now.  Many fed officials are talking about a fed funds rate at 3-4% and several are even mentioning balance sheet runoff.\n\nI'm here to tell you they are completely full of shit.  We won't even get close to 4% fed funds rate this cycle.  And that's because as a nation we are increasingly dependent on low interest rates to finance the national debt (as well as private debt).\n\nThat's because the national debt has absolutely exploded over time.  Debt to GDP has increased from 30% in the 70s to 125% now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/767ffk2tx5b81.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b3beaabaa8f5ffdb07d31b660c0341055d61945\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis massive increase in the debt means that interest payments on that debt increase as the fed raises interest rates.  Thus every hiking cycle for the past 40 years has resulted in a lower and lower peak fed funds rate before the market breaks and the fed capitulates and begins easing again (aka the money printer kicks into high gear).  The last peak in 2018 was a fed funds rate of 2.25-2.50% before markets plunged 25% in the 4th quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sn4shjqky5b81.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31e9984d76d5aab315817cb563733df3e8662e14\n\nBut the debt is even higher now than it was in 2018, so we know the next ceiling will have to be lower as well.  I've analyzed this by looking at the average of the fed funds rate and the 5-year treasury yield and multiplying this combined rate by the national debt.\n\nIf we assume both rates increase in tandem by 25 basis points per quarter, and the national debt goes up a paltry $300 billion quarterly (its been going up much faster than this recently), then we will cap out at just 1.25-1.50% this cycle.  Likely in the 2nd quarter of 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmvaredrw5b81.png?width=1344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75bb7bc23243c9f151daddc8aa979a71eb799680\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when markets are crashing after only the 5th rate hike, and inflation is still running at over 5% annually, just know that the fed is going to capitulate and save the markets by easing again.\n\nThis is a big problem, because you need treasury yields to get above inflation expectations in order to encourage savings instead of spending to stop inflation.  In the 70s, with debt to GDP at only 30%, we were able to do just that.  It wasn't painless (look at the recession of the early 80s), but we did it.  With inflation at 5-10%, we can't even get close to stopping it without absolutely decimating the stock market and the economy.\n\nSo the fed is trapped.  They are going to have to choose between switching to easing and saving the economy and stock market, or continuing to hike in an attempt to kill inflation, but also causing the great depression 2.0 in the process.  I'm confident they will choose to save markets and stop fighting inflation as the tradeoff, which means that the inflation trades at that point will be going absolutely bananas.\n\nAnd that's because the US will finally be embarking on monetary policy akin to a banana republic by lowering rates while experiencing high inflation.\n\nSo make sure you get YOUR bananas over the next year to prepare for this utter bullshit of a ride that the fed is about to take us on.  For me that means precious metals (specifically silver via PSLV and physical, not SLV which is a bullshit ETF).  I also like platinum and uranium a lot as well. For others it could mean other commodities, energy plays, or real estate. Or even just buying a whole bunch of shit before it goes up in price.\n\nGood luck my friends, this is the end game!",
    "content_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fed has fucked up.  Inflation wasn&amp;#39;t transitory and their favorite measure, core PCE, is the highest it&amp;#39;s been in 4 decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now they have to look like they are fighting inflation by raising rates and tapering asset purchases.  They are talking quite a big game right now.  Many fed officials are talking about a fed funds rate at 3-4% and several are even mentioning balance sheet runoff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m here to tell you they are completely full of shit.  We won&amp;#39;t even get close to 4% fed funds rate this cycle.

    "content": "\n**GEWD MORNING**\n-\nI'm back with updates!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMonths ago, I stated the demand and importance of LNG in the upcoming years? Yeeeeaaah, well those needs came quicker. There is now a global energy CRISIS:\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-04/europe-s-energy-supply-crisis-has-the-eu-at-the-mercy-of-putin-and-the-weather\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_global_energy_crisis\n\nIt used to be harder for fossil fuel start-ups to get bank financing due to not being viewed as \"green\".  But now that, you know, there is an energy crisis, the EU is trying to get nuclear and LNG fuels listed as GREEN. For those that have a chromosome tolerance of \u00b1 1, LNG is the cleanest burning fossil fuel and is poised to be the energy source for the foreseeable future. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/business/europe-green-investments-nuclear-natural-gas.html\n\nBecause of this current climate, it has set Tellurian to EXPLODE. I know, I know, most of you don't know how to operate the shiny buttons on the TV, so you may have not seen the news. Have a parent or guardian help you with viewing the current crisis unfolding in front of your useless eyes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**To summarize from my last DD:**\nTellurian is building Driftwood which is \"developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Once complete, the terminal will be able to export up to twenty-seven million, six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide.\"\n\nCharif Souki started Tellurian. If you don\u2019t know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, and pioneered the LNG industry. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Energy, the first company to export LNG from the US. A company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80/share(**updated: now at $100+/share**).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTellurian has multi-billion dollar LNG purchase agreements with: Gunvor, Vitol, and Shell.\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/072921-shell-agrees-to-buy-3-million-mtyear-of-supply-from-tellurians-driftwood-lng\n\n**When these deals were signed, JKM pricing was in the $10-15 range.

He also stated that banks' attitudes toward \n    energy financing have dramatically changed over the last 6 months because of the crisis as explained above.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**I VISITED ONGOING CONSTRUCTION:**\n\nDOT is mandating that highways leading to Driftwood need to be widened to accept construction traffic. This construction is currently underway as well as power utility company running new power lines.\n\nAs stated in my last DD, I work in the area. I decided to drop by the construction site and take some pictures and videos for those who can't read. I also asked some questions to construction workers. \n\n**Here are my findings:**\n\nI talked to a gas station owner who is located on the Driftwood highway. He confirmed that TELL was doing the work. I asked him when construction would begin, and he confirmed March or April. I asked more questions and he directed me to Tellurian's temporary office. I drove by but didn't see anyone around. As I was leaving the office, I flagged down a truck slowly passing me. He works for a company who has a lot of land in the area. He said a \"company\" was clearing a bunch of trees and making driveways into the woods. He pointed in the direction that the Driftwood terminal will be built.\n\nNext, I talked to one of the construction flaggers located a few hundred yards from the office. He works for Entergy (power company for those who don't know). He said they are running new power lines - I assume these are power lines for Driftwood. They're doing some pretty serious work headed in the direction of Driftwood. Power for Driftwood will be a serious power addition; I doubt Entergy would be making these additions unless Driftwood construction was certain.\n\nThen, I stopped next to a truck that had been watching the road construction crew (he was the construction supervisor). I asked him if the road construction was for Tellurian. He said yes and that things were going well. I asked him when he expects to finish, he said JULY! I asked him if Tellurian had been pressuring them on a constrained timeline. He said, \"No, actually they gave us certain deadlines for certain stages AND WE ARE WELL AHEAD OF THEIR DEADLINE.\".\n\nI asked him if they need to finish the road work before Driftwood construction can begin. He said \"No, they can start bringing in equipment while we're working. Our main goal is finishing the turnoff from the main highway so that we are not impeding traffic.\". I asked him if he worked for Tellurian, he told me no but the guy in the truck next to him did.\n\nSo I walked over to the Tellurian employee's window and asked how things were going. Super nice guy. He said things are going very well. I asked him if they are still expected to start construction in the second quarter. He confidently said, \"Oh yes, construction in the second quarter.\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSee this link for my pictures and videos of the ongoing construction.\nhttps://1drv.ms/f/s!Anxr6tk-0ohkgZxJUAZcVhf7p-wPAQ\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tl;dr and additional facts:** \n\n\n-Undervalued company is about to build an LNG plant that will help mitigate the global energy crisis.\n\n\n-The current energy crisis and potential EU classification of LNG as \"green\" crafts a perfect \n    environment to finalize financing of the Tellurian Driftwood LNG facility. \n\n\n-This morning, Tellurian's founder Charif Souki, industry legend, reaffirmed the financing and \n    construction timeline. \n\n\n-Tellurian has been actively posting and hiring important positions in the company with top-of-the-line hires. \n\n\n-On site road construction workers, a local gas station owner, and a Tellurian employee \n    confirmed construction timelines.\n\n\n-$80 million in revenue this year, $200 million in revenue next year - exponential growth baby!\n\n\n-Stock has recently up listed to NYSE\n\n\n-Stock has been added to Russel 2000 and 3000 as of 11/24/21\n\n\n-Earnings have doubled since last year and stock price is not reflecting the rapid growth as of yet.\n\n\n-Europe is burning coal as their renewables are not providing what they need\n\n\n-TELL estimates they will account for 24% of global natural gas supply\n\n\n-Carbon futures in Europe are screaming higher\n\n\n-LNG prices in Europe and Asia are ridiculously expensive compared to USA Henry Hub prices\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Price predictions:** \n\n\nprice after FID: $6-8\n\n\nprice after NTP: $10-15\n\n\nprice mid-construction: $20-30\n\n\nprice after first liquification train is complete: $50-70",

Yeeeeaaah, well those needs came quicker. There is now a global energy CRISIS:\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-04/europe-s-energy-supply-crisis-has-the-eu-at-the-mercy-of-putin-and-the-weather\"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-04/europe-s-energy-supply-crisis-has-the-eu-at-the-mercy-of-putin-and-the-weather&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_global_energy_crisis\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_global_energy_crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It used to be harder for fossil fuel start-ups to get bank financing due to not being viewed as &amp;quot;green&amp;quot;.  But now that, you know, there is an energy crisis, the EU is trying to get nuclear and LNG fuels listed as GREEN. For those that have a chromosome tolerance of \u00b1 1, LNG is the cleanest burning fossil fuel and is poised to be the energy source for the foreseeable future. &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/business/europe-green-investments-nuclear-natural-gas.html\"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/business/europe-green-investments-nuclear-natural-gas.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of this current climate, it has set Tellurian to EXPLODE. I know, I know, most of you don&amp;#39;t know how to operate the shiny buttons on the TV, so you may have not seen the news. Have a parent or guardian help you with viewing the current crisis unfolding in front of your useless eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To summarize from my last DD:&lt;/strong&gt;\nTellurian is building Driftwood which is &amp;quot;developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Once complete, the terminal will be able to export up to twenty-seven million, six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Charif Souki started Tellurian. If you don\u2019t know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, and pioneered the LNG industry. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Energy, the first company to export LNG from the US. A company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80/share(&lt;strong&gt;updated: now at $100+/share&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tellurian has multi-billion dollar LNG purchase agreements with: Gunvor, Vitol, and Shell.\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/072921-shell-agrees-to-buy-3-million-mtyear-of-supply-from-tellurians-driftwood-lng\"&gt;https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/072921-shell-agrees-to-buy-3-million-mtyear-of-supply-from-tellurians-driftwood-lng&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When these deals were signed, JKM pricing was in the $10-15 range.

You need another revenue stream, and right now, options might be your best bet*.\n\nMany people have misconceptions about trading options.

With a put, you have the right to sell stock at a particular time for a specific price. On the other hand, a call gives you the right to buy the stock at a particular price at a specific time. \n\nMost people buy stocks hoping the value will increase. Investors, however, will buy puts to reduce the risk of their stock positions declining. *Remember,* ***when stock prices drop, put prices go up and vice-versa***, so constant demand for puts often creates a fear premium.\n\nCall prices don't usually trade at the same high premiums as bearish puts. That's not to say that call prices are bad; in fact, they are generally quite decent. Similar to buying shares, people buy calls hoping that stock prices will go up. There are fewer investors that choose to sell puts, probably because *there is more risk involved with selling puts*.\n\n**You need to sell them!**\n\nSelling options on the stocks in your portfolio, or stocks that you would like to add to your holdings, is a time-tested strategy for increasing your profits and decreasing risk.\n\nWhen you **sell** puts, you have a chance to buy stocks you like at lower prices. When you **sell** calls, you can collect premium while waiting for your stocks to rise in value.\u00a0Both of these trades can generate income for you while reducing your risk.\n\nA lot of jargon gets tossed around about options trading, and may seem confusing, but you don't have to know the technical names for every strategy to benefit from them.\n\nSelling a call against a stock is what's known as a **buy-write**, or sometimes it's known as a **covered call** or an **over-write;** they all mean more or less the same thing, which is selling a call on a stock. With a buy-write, you are buying stock while at the same time selling a call. Whereas, for an over-write or covered call, you are selling an option against stock that you already hold.\u00a0\n\nSelling puts against a stock position is known as a **cash-secured put**. Likewise, a **naked put** is when you sell a put on a stock that you don't already own.\n\n# Examples of how selling options can generate income\n\nConsider the covered call strategy. With a covered call, you can set a sale price when you first buy a stock. So, let's say that you buy a stock for $100, you could then immediately set the sale price at, say, $250. So, in essence, you would effectively be selling $250 in strike calls against that stock to boost your revenue. ***That is to say that you can generate income even if the stock stays flat at $100****.*\n\nOn the flip side, cash-secured puts can be used to generate income while you wait for a desired stock to go down to the price you would like to pay to own it. ***Essentially generating income while you wait for that asset to go on sale.***\n\nThe risks associated with selling options comes in when investors fly too close to the sun. This could be using leverage they can't afford to open the positions, or being tempted by higher premiums to choose short expiry dates and near at-the-money strikes. If the contract goes in the money at expiration, you risk getting assigned (having shares called away or margin calls to purchase the shares you're obligated to buy). \n\nOptions trading may not be for everyone, but it also isn't as scary or complicated as many people think. Trading options can be a great way to make a decent amount of revenue while at the same time decreasing your risk on the stock positions that you hold already or would like to hold.",

This could be using leverage they can&amp;#39;t afford to open the positions, or being tempted by higher premiums to choose short expiry dates and near at-the-money strikes. If the contract goes in the money at expiration, you risk getting assigned (having shares called away or margin calls to purchase the shares you&amp;#39;re obligated to buy). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Options trading may not be for everyone, but it also isn&amp;#39;t as scary or complicated as many people think. Trading options can be a great way to make a decent amount of revenue while at the same time decreasing your risk on the stock positions that you hold already or would like to hold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Cranjin has alot of footage of this. I&amp;#39;m not going to go into this for this post. But he definitely plays more defense than LeBron for the full game and makes the proper switches.  LeBron takes more plays off on defense and does not box out as the center.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "content": "I am a software developer with around 4 years of experience. I've worked as a front-end developer and this question might sound anecdotal, but I was wondering if this is actually normal and happens to a lot of people in my industry and maybe others as well.\n\nI was a front-end developer in my first job and also developed mobile apps sometimes, when my boss asked for proofs of concept.

I didn't have any work to do, any projects to work on for a long time (almost a whole year).\n\nI was being paid more than 99% of the workers in my country (Brazil) and the salary was great, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being paid to do nothing and while I did complain many times to my higher ups about it (they were completely aware of the situation), I couldn't help but feel that I needed to pretend I was working whenever the CEO or my CTO came around the office (really rare occurrences).\n\nSo there I was, wasting 8 hours of each day not really working on anything. When I wasn't pretending to work, I was using the time to study for college, to learn new technologies and programming languages and working on side projects for my portfolio as a developer.\n\nMy friends and family all thought I was lucky to be paid so well while not having to do any real work, but if anyone has ever been in that situation, you know that it's horrible.\n\nAnd I thought it would be a one time thing, that I had found the only job in the world where I was paid to do nothing (excluding politicians I guess).\n\nAnd then I had enough, decided to quit that job and look for another one, and so I did.\n\nMy next job I actually had a lot of projects to work on.

    "content": "Disclaimer: I am not a doctor or PT tech. Always consult an expert for medical advice.\n\nOver the past year I\u2019ve experienced some significant benefits from simple stretching/foam rolling every night for 30-60 min. As much as I always said \u201cI don\u2019t have time,\u201d I\u2019ve found putting on an episode of a show or throwing on some YouTube videos have made the process easier to commit to; and now it feels like a simple routine. If I have time to play on my phone, then I have time to invest in my own body. My day to day aches and pains have drastically been reduced to nearly non-existent, my flexibility has increased, and I find myself more motivated to exercise. 5 years of active duty military time, 13 years in Law Enforcement, and many miles ran and biked have really done a number on my body; all in which I ignored the simplicity of some nightly stretches. I still can\u2019t get over how great my back and hips feel. Granted, it has taken me a bit of time to research and experiment with various muscle groups to best target a plethora of areas.\n\nEDIT - FOR THOSE ASKINF WHAT I DO:\nMany commenters have asked for my individual stretching routine. First and foremost, I want to say that what works for you will likely be very individualized. I carry a vest and gun belt at work which had caused me a lot of knee, lower back and hip pain. My wife convinced my to try yoga a year ago, which I found to be a tremendous help in finding some stretched. I\u2019ve found countless stretches through YouTube videos and Google searches, but not an individual resource I could point anyone to. Many of which I also recalled from high school gym class many years ago. I will generally hold positions anywhere from 10 seconds to 2 minutes. The importance is to be feeling the stretch and not extreme discomfort. Flexibility will come with time, so don\u2019t over do it. You will notice form is crucial to actually targeting muscle groups, and if you don\u2019t feel the stretch, you may need to revisit your form. Once again, I am not a medical professional, but this is what\u2019s worked for me:\n\nThese are generally the ones I hit every night, but I will sprinkle some different stuff in from time to time in addition. I generally start the first bit of my stretch in a deep squat with my knees tucked into my armpits. Leaning forward and looking straight forward seems to hit both my calves and back.\n\nI slowly transition out of this position (and every position) and cross my legs, but place my foot on top of my knee instead. I then lean forward until my elbows are touching the ground for a bit, then switch my legs to the opposing position. Sometimes I will draw one leg behind me to get a deeper stretch. This seems to hit my ITB and help relieve tension and pain off my knees. \n\nI then put both legs in front and wrap my hands over the top of my toes while looking down and rounding my my back. This seems to hit my hamstring and back pretty well. \n\nFollowing this I will bring one foot toward my butt, then over my quad, and I will hug the folded leg while leaning back a bit, until I feel my glute targeted.\n\nI then lay flat on my back, resting my foot on my knee, wrapping both hands around the upper shin of the leg my knee is resting on, and pulling back toward my chest. \n\nAfter, I sit up and I draw my feet together toward my groin, pulling up on my toes for a bit, and then I lean forward again to my elbows. \n\nI will then kneel, with my butt touching my heels and my toes pointed directly behind me for a bit. \n\nI then stand up and touch my toes/ground with my feet together. Then I bring my feet beyond should width apart and stretch toward each foot, and then again to the center. \n\nI then turn to my bed, where I stand about a step back, then lean my quads onto the bed and lean back, targeting my calves. After this I will generally stay with my quads agains the bed but standing closer, and grab each foot behind me to target my quads. \n\nI usually then grab my hands behind my butt, lean back, and roll my shoulders back to stretch out my chest. \n\nI will foam roll/theragun before or after stretching, depending on how I feel. I will lay on the floor with my foam roller and really focus on the entire circumstance of my upper legs, outer hips, and glutes, utilizing as much body weight as I can while staying balanced.",

A tweak as simple as closing my eyes has been a big memorization aid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try it out and see if it makes a difference!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "title": "If you\u2019re conventionally attractive, life is automatically 100x easier for you",
    "content": "Go on tiktok right now to see what I mean. Attractive people are being handed million dollar branding deals and getting millions upon millions of followers for literally staring at a camera. Absolutely no talent, skill or personality needed. Even if they do have skills I\u2019m sure having tons of validation and constant support helps you stay motivated. Everyone pretty much knows this but what really bothers me is these people don\u2019t even acknowledge how much it benefits them. They didn\u2019t get these things solely cause they \u201cworked hard\u201d, they got it because being physically attractive makes everything easier. When you\u2019re physically attractive you can pretty much do anything and people will forgive you. You can lack integrity, honesty, you can fuck people over, you can be creepy and get away with all of it. Even studies show that attractive people get way less severe punishments for the same crimes. All you have to do if you\u2019re attractive is not murder people and you\u2019re life is pretty much set on easy mode. Making friends and business connections will be a breeze, lame jokes you tell will come off as funnier, any weird or disturbing trait you possess will come off as cute and quirky, people may even give you stuff for free or invite you to exclusive events, simply because you\u2019re attractive. If you\u2019re attractive just know that you have been handed the good life on a golden platter. You can get by with one tenth the effort of the average person and still gain more respect for the same amount of work. The people who will truly understand what I mean are those who went from being conventionally ugly/below average to conventionally attractive\u2026 whether it was from puberty, weight loss, surgery, etc. The difference in how people treated you before and after is astounding to say the least. People who are born with it though will never truly understand how it influences almost every aspect of their life.\n\n\nEdit: Before anyone calls me out on sounding bitter, just know this also comes from my own personal experience from how I was treated before and after puberty and from what I see going on around me as well. What I\u2019m saying is nothing new, we all know this is going on but I feel this is becoming more and more apparent as the world we live in becomes more centered around appearances and garnering attention. I\u2019m not saying attractive people don\u2019t suffer but they do have easier access to opportunities that the average citizen does not.\n\n**EDIT2:** Okay so I\u2019m really enjoying the discussion this has brought up. Some people have brought up some interesting points that I would like to address. I just want to say that everyone\u2019s life has suffering no matter what you are blessed with. Hearing downsides to attractiveness like sexual assault, objectification, etc are also very real. I also want to point out that attractiveness doesn\u2019t guarantee success but more that it just contributes to being socially validated everywhere you go making it \u201cextremely easier for the chance at success\u201d. Of course everyone still has to put in effort. At the end of the day though, life is unfair and like a lot of people mentioned, we all need to play with cards we\u2019ve been dealt as best as we can. If you are \u201cunattractive\u201d I would say try everything out there to raise your odds like losing weight, exercising, grooming, etc. Once you\u2019ve maxed out this area it really is up to you to stand out in other ways. This may mean you have to put it in more work than some but that\u2019s just the way it is. At the end of the day, just try to be as grateful as possible for what you have because we\u2019re all going to die and none of this will matter lol.\n\n**EDIT3:** A Reddit commenter hjalex22 posted a real life example that explains EXACTLY what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n*\u201cThe epitome of this principle is Jeremy Meeks. Low life criminal is a member of crips of something, beats a kid to near death and lands himself in prison.  Police department posts his mugshot on Facebook for some reason and instantly recieves 100s of thousands of love letters as well as 1000s of dollars to post his bail. He gets out and lands multiple modelling gigs and is now a multi millionaire and model. The worst part is he believes he got where he is by \"working hard\". This man lives like a king constantly being fawned over by women and it's all because it was written in his DNA. There is no justice  in this world.

    "content_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go on tiktok right now to see what I mean. Attractive people are being handed million dollar branding deals and getting millions upon millions of followers for literally staring at a camera. Absolutely no talent, skill or personality needed. Even if they do have skills I\u2019m sure having tons of validation and constant support helps you stay motivated. Everyone pretty much knows this but what really bothers me is these people don\u2019t even acknowledge how much it benefits them. They didn\u2019t get these things solely cause they \u201cworked hard\u201d, they got it because being physically attractive makes everything easier. When you\u2019re physically attractive you can pretty much do anything and people will forgive you. You can lack integrity, honesty, you can fuck people over, you can be creepy and get away with all of it. Even studies show that attractive people get way less severe punishments for the same crimes. All you have to do if you\u2019re attractive is not murder people and you\u2019re life is pretty much set on easy mode.

    "content": "TW: sexual assault/violence \n\nIt\u2019s been five fucking years now and he\u2019s still so reactive. I used to take him to the dog park and walk him without a leash because he recalled and heeled so well he would come right back and get his leash whenever I called. He was such a sweet boy, loved everyone and I took him everywhere with me for the first 4 years of his life.\n\nOne night, I was drugged by someone we knew. My sweet boy was locked in his crate, in plain sight of everything. This fucking asshole even invited someone, and I still don\u2019t know who it was and it fucking rips me apart. My sweet dog turned into a monster, his face was ripped and his gums were swollen because he was trying to get out. \n\nToday I had to break him from another lunge/ snarl/ bite cycle from our nice neighbor with his super sweet German shepherd. Taking him for walks is so exhausting. Taking him to the dog park is out of the equation. He is a border collie golden retriever mix, everyone wants to pet him and I always have to say no. I have to put him away when new people come to our house. He\u2019s on Prozac and trazedone and gabbapentin, it doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve read the books, paid professionals, talked to the vet, tried everything I can think of. He\u2019s never bit anyone. When it\u2019s just us, he\u2019s the same dog he\u2019s always been. He\u2019s been mine for almost 9 years now, through all of my 20s, the birth of my daughter. He\u2019s so sweet to all children, messes with the cat all day but has never hurt her in his life (had her longer). He\u2019s not actually aggressive he\u2019s just still so fucking scared of men and it makes me feel so fucked in the head. He had ribbons, he visited veterans, stayed with me always. He was such a sweet boy. And it\u2019s so hard to heal from it when this just keeps reminding me how we both broke that night.\n\nETA: I have gotten some really good advice since posting and I want to say thank you to all of you who took the time to respond in a kind manner. I don\u2019t need to defend myself but I will on two points here: \n1. This happened five years ago, my daughter is 3.5. I no longer drink after this incident happened, I definitely did not have my daughter with me or being babysat for me to have an irresponsible time. I would also like to touch on this on behalf of other women, we as a society need to fix the victim blaming cycle. It shouldn\u2019t matter what I was doing, wearing, or what neighborhood I was in at the time. Over 40% of women have experienced sexual violence, remember that next time you look at the women in your life. Less than 20% of rapes are reported because of what happens when others find out and don\u2019t believe you. 1 in 6 women will be rapped ANNUALLY in the US. Over 80% of sexual assaults are committed by an acquaintance. \n2. My dog was a rescue who was already well adapted to his crate. I didn\u2019t close the door anymore at that point, he just would pace and pace and howl until I put it back up because he had a blanket over top and would go in there like it was his own little house. He still shoves himself in tight spaces to lay down, he prefers it. Those of you who took this post as an argument against crates probably have never used one. It\u2019s not something you force them into, that would be abusive. It was his little fort, he was very attached to it, I did take the door off after this happened and phased it out over time because I couldn\u2019t look at it anymore. That is all.\n\nEdit #2: some have asked for pics of my boy, link here:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/bI6IOEQ",

    "content": "TLDR: I am a 23yo who hasn't even talked to a girl in months. I decided I don't want to be a virgin anymore, so I went to a \"massage\" place. Extremely underwhelmed.\n\n\nSo I'm 23 years old and my love is completely tragic. I have never had a girlfriend, never been on a date and other than a few lady friends I made back in school, I literally have not even talked to a girl in months.\n\nI decided it was enough. I dont want to be a virgin anymore. So I just searched online and I found a place near my apartment. Before going i was seriously scared of getting in trouble somehow, or maybe even finding out that the place is some sort of organ trafficking ring. \n\nNo joke, that was my biggest fear. What if im in the room doing my thing and suddenly 2 dudes show up and tie me down and take my kidneys. \n\nEventually I said fuck it, and I went. When I first walked in I tried to fake confidence, I did not want the \"receptionist\" to know that im a complete newbie to these things, so I acted confident and I just told her what I want. \n\nShe told me to pay first and I did, then she told me to go to one of the rooms and wait. A few minutes later one of the girls came in. She was in her 30s, not atrociously ugly but still far from attractive. \n\nI was surprised, I thought I get to choose the girl, but I was too nervous to say anything.\n\nThe woman started right away, and for the first 10 mins of having fun, I was not enjoying it all, I was actually quite bored. She kept touching me all over, and I was just there, looking, not moving or doing anything. I was not sure of what to do or say. So i just let her do her thing. \n\nShe then told me to lay down, so she can start sucking me. At that point ive been in there for 20+ minutes, but I still was not aroused, not even a bit. She then started the blowjob, and I was still not feeling it. I dont mean I was not feeling anything because I was, but it just wasn't anything that special?\n\nShe kept on sucking, and I was just there thinking \"What happens now? is this it? is this sex?\"\n\nShe kept sucking and sucking and there was still no reaction from me. she was clearly and visibly getting bored, and honestly so was I. She could have kept sucking for hours and I still dont think anything would have changed. Eventually I decided to end it. I told her to stop and I finished myself off in seconds. Literally seconds. This woman was there sucking me off like there's no tomorrow but it went nowhere. I touched myself for seconds and I immediately finished.  \n\nAfter that I just left the place quickly and decided to walk home. I asked myself many questions. \n\n\"Am I gay?\" \"was that just how sex normally goes?\" \"Did I really pay all that money just to finish myself off?\" \"was she just ugly and bad at her job?\"\n\n\nnow, A day later, I do not regret it. Im just so, underwhelmed. It was like when all your friends tell you to go watch that one movie thats supposedly the greatest film in history, and then you go watch it and it turns out to be just a movie, extremely over hyped and really not worth all that praise.",

But I don&amp;#39;t know how to do that. I&amp;#39;m autistic. I have tried all the ways of offering support I can think of but I just can&amp;#39;t figure out what she wants from me. She literally asked me to be supportive while saying that we can have differing opinions, but I can&amp;#39;t question what her reality is. So basically I can&amp;#39;t talk about or react about it because every miniscule eye movement she detects is overanalyzed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She literally can&amp;#39;t just not analyze people. Everything must be explained. The eye twitch must have a reason. That person must have some sort of something going on- they&amp;#39;re abusive, narcissistic, autistic, etc. Everyone must be labelled. I don&amp;#39;t understand why she can&amp;#39;t just brush things off and not worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just so tired of walking on eggshells around her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a rant but I needed somewhere to share it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Didn\u2019t even charge her extra. This woman would slam the door at all hours, went through 1 roll of toilet paper a day and would extend her stay everyday but would only pay if I hounded her for the money for 30 minutes. Once she left, I found cat litter everywhere and my dishes were being used to feed and water her cat. Still haven\u2019t been able to get the cat smell out of the room. \n\nThe second dude looked through every single drawer I own, threw out my lightly used masks and various other things I was saving like paper coasters. He also freely used anything else he found in the kitchen. The weirdest thing I saw him do was lather his face with my very expensive olive oil, then he would wash it off and redo it about 5+ times. Never asked once. He would come and go, only staying one day at a time. I eventually had to tell him it was no longer available because cleaning and washing in between his stays was getting exhausting and honestly, him looking through everything I own gave me anxiety. Whenever I would walk into my own kitchen he gave me a death glare until I left. Pretty sure he stole a few negligible things like a usb c charging brick too.\n\nThe last dude seemed perfectly normal at first until he strung me along for his next night\u2019s payment. At the last minute he told me he didn\u2019t have the money so I asked him to leave. He got very upset, apparently I was disrespectful for not accepting payment in weed. He also started demanding payment for his lost property (which was stolen from a cart he left right next to the apartment\u2019s trash cans, which I warned him not to do.) I heard him in his room yelling about punching me in the face so I called the cops on him. Before he left, he threw a bottle of his urine/bong water all over the bed.

Also there\u2019s a huge amount of people that make reservations and just never show up, which is a dick move when I could have offered it to someone else that needed it. \n\nI\u2019m so sick of having to interact with other people to live.

The only thing I was slightly irritated about was that my mom was going out about my niece how she's having to watch her and that's not the problem it's just like she's a little upset that the babies upset because that we don't know why she's cranky she just is.\n\nSo my mom thinks I'm all pissed off that I have to work today and I'm like not at all I'm actually on the other hand happy. I finally have a job and I'm happy that I can go to work and stuff. My mother doesn't understand what I'm actually annoyed about is my niece. She's just at 6 months old and she cries about literally everything and I know that's how babies are and I know that you sort of just have to live with it kind of thing but I'm over here like I don't have to I'm not uncle I can leave. I have no responsibility whatsoever and my mom basically doesn't like when I bring that up.\n\nSo she finally accepted it today that I don't want children. I just don't want the responsibility. I want my money to be my money and I don't want to throw money at the wall basically wondering if it's going to stick. I think to myself hey let's put my kid in karate oh well he didn't like it and it was too hard but to try something else. Oh he wants to do gymnastics oh he doesn't like gymnastics but put him in something else. Oh let's get him a bike that he's only going to ride three times a week if that maybe he'll ride three times a month.\n\nIf I've learned anything about children is that they're the most selfish individuals possible and they just want something in the moment. Honestly you know we should do, all the things they want we should have like rental services for this kind of stuff like they want it for a certain amount of time and when you're done you can take it back and you get a refund or partial refund. The only wanted to write a bike for like a weekend and then they never want to write it again you just go ahead and take it back.\n\nAnd then I think about every single time that I've ever gotten in trouble at school and my mom had to show up where every time I screwed something up in the house and my dad would get pissed off. I think to myself I don't want to be that person. I don't want to be the person that's getting pissed off at my children for doing something stupid. Let's face it, although our parents love us to death or we may love our children to death or our nieces and nephews, we know that they're all idiots and we're idiots in general. We're all adults that are reading this supposedly and we're looking at this thinking wow we are stupid.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do enjoy being an uncle from time to time. I love my nieces and nephews profusely. There's nothing I wouldn't do for them. I hear this thump sound The other day and I hear my sister scream like in this bloody murder scared oh my God something's terrible going on. Then I hear my niece crying. I run in there ASAP out of bed to check on her and my sister's crying but my niece is fine she fell off the bed but she's okay. Scared the shit out of me scared to show my sister.\n\nIt's not that I don't care about our future or anything like that, it's more like I just don't really care that much. I just don't care about humans in general anymore. Over the last couple of years I've become missing topic with reality and people like and I'm just like I don't really care. I'm just glad my mom finally took the hint that I don't want children.

I'm only mentioning ages to say how long ago this was hell he met the girl on Myspace so I think 2006. Either way, he confessed &amp; we decided to stay together. While I have had moments of distrust since then I had pretty much gotten over it. We moved in together shortly after &amp; have lived our lives together mostly happily, I mean I really adore him &amp; believe he is a good man. We have a nice home together &amp; 2 beautiful babies together. However, just last week the infidelity came up &amp; for the 1st time ever in 15 years he confessed that he slept with her twice not just once as I've always thought. It was like fresh salt on an old wound &amp; it really hurts. I'm completely devastated. I've always thought he cheated &amp; felt so bad he had to confess now I feel like he really enjoyed it more than he let on , I mean I was with men before him &amp; if I had a bad sexual experience I wouldn't go back.. he tells me it wasn't like that he was just young &amp; dumb &amp; didn't have much sexual experience &amp; basically just wanted sex but that also doesn't make sense to me bc we have always had a good sex life we are very sexually compatible &amp; at the time we had not had any problems, I don't even remember an argument between us at the time. Am I being completely unreasonable to still feel like this after 15 years?! I have forgiven but I can't forget &amp; I do have some resentment over the whole thing. The logical side of me is saying girl get tf over it he was just a kid &amp; I understand that &amp; he has always apologized &amp; shown remorse but no matter what I tell myself I have intrusive thoughts telling me differently. Has anyone been through something similar? I don't want to lose the life we've built over this but my brain is really obsessive, once I get something on my mind it's almost impossible for me not to dwell on it. I'd also like to add just for the hell of it I do believe he hasn't done it since see the girl ended up being a really bad person &amp; committed a horrific crime in 2007 &amp; went to prison so he has always maintained that scared him to know he messed with someone he didn't even know of what they could be capable of.

    "content": "This happened about 14 years ago and was a wild ride and ended up in me handing in my notice at my job.\n\nI worked at a 2nd hand buy for cash shop. They are a big company in Australia and have a lot of locations in the UK.\n\nI had worked there for about 4 months prior to the events that are about to unfold and had seen all the bad and desperate people try and sell stolen or broken items for cash in hand to do whatever. I told myself it wasn't drugs or gambling habits but I knew otherwise. I needed money straight out of University and was the only job in my area hiring at the time.\n\nOne day a very beautiful, well dressed young woman came in. Not one to frequent my place of work but we do see well off people getting rid of good items form time to time. She came to my counter looking to pawn some jewellery. The jewellery she had was top end stuff. 3ct diamond rings 22ct gold neckalces. Really good sapphires Ruby etc. She was looking for a buy back pawn option and wanted about \u00a31.5k for the lot. We had to take it to our expert who firmed the worth. It was worth about 2.5k in total so her asking for 1.5k was reasonable and with approval from upper management we bought it. Thought nothing of it and moved on to the next customer.\n\nA month later she comes in again with more jewellery. Again our expert assessed and worth about 3k, she wanted 2k. We were like great here is your money we can make that back. As our pawn works on a 10% buy back within 6 months. If they come in and buy it back its what we paid plus 10% and after 6 months we could do what we want with it.\n\nThat happened every month for about a year. Soemtimes it was valued at 2k sometime up to 6k. Sometimes she would come in with equally well dressed good looking early 20s and each time someone different.\n\nWe started to make up stories, who is she, what does she do. Our best guess either she was rich and bored with the jewellery and wanted cash or the most concrete back story, at least in our minds, was she was a high end escort and she was paid in expensive jewellery. Both never made actual sense but we saw all sorts of characters in our shop and unfortunately the most negative story was usually the correct one.\n\nSo after a year she stopped coming in. Manager was a bit upset as she never wanted her jewellery back so we could always make a really good profit on her items. Our days of being No1 in Pawn buying every month was finally over. I served her every time and was slightly concerned she hadn't been in. We had our regulas but she was always nice and happy to have a chat and one of my positive interactions on my job.\n\nAbout 3 months pass. I was working the cash counter and our manager was working a different store when suddenly a well dressed middle aged man burst into the shop came up to me and started screaming for the manager, our assistant manager come up and asks whats up. Suddenly she appears with bright red eyes, mascara down her face and didn't look her normal well dressed self, she was in joggers and a hoodie and looked like she has just been through an ordeal.\n\nSo myself and the assistant manager asked the man to calm down, which only made him more irate until we threatened to call the police. He calmed down and asked that the shop be shut for a couple of minutes while he said what he wanted to say.\n\nTurns out the girl was his daughter and had been stealing her mother's jewellery and pawning it off so she could go partying. Her father only found out when his wife went to find the gold necklace with the sapphire and couldn't find it, then searched for other items and couldn't find them too. When the dad went to call the police she confessed and had a massive row and then came straight to the shop still in this emotional state.\n\nHe asked how much she had pawned off. Total \u00a330,500 (value of all the items was around \u00a365k). He went crazy again until we again said we would call the police if he didn't calm down. \n\nHe asked if he could get the items back. \n\nWe said that he would have to buy them back. Again went into a rage and this was his final warning about calling the police. He said he wanted all his items back now and we said he would have to file a police report to seize the items and then go though the procedures with his daughter most likely getting into trouble for stealing \u00a365k worth of jewellery and selling it signing papers it was hers to sell. He said ok he would like to buy it all back.\n\nWe said some items have expired and that they were either sold or in this shop and others on displa or in our HQ safe. He asked how much he can get back. We had about 20k worth of jewellery in the safe so said right now he could get that back for 22k the we called maager but he didn't pick up so called HQ they said rest would have to be bought at retail if we still had it. We had all but about 4k worth of jewellery somewhere in our company and most of that was standard neckalces rings. Total cost to buy all items was c\u00a351k. He paused for a second, looked at his daughter as if to think if he should pay or get it back for free snd let her get into trouble. \n\nHe got a card out and said I'll pay for everything now and be back in tomorrow for the rest. They both left the shop and I never saw them again as the next day I was off and there was no chance I was going into the store that day.\n\nManager was racing back to the store as this was happening and got back and was told the full story. He was so happy, we just made as a shop made 20k in profit on jewellery in one day. I was astounded that all he could think about was the money, not how me and the assistant manager were after the ordeal just how much money we made.\n\nTurns out so did HQ. We were made the best shop of the year and my manager had a little article in the monthly newsletter. I hated myself, hated this job now as the fact we just buy anything and fund whatever, keep people in debt and be basically where the desperate go. But I still needed money so I carried on until the day before payday. \n\nOur manager came to me and said good news. Because you bought all the jewellery and technically sold it all, you are getting a \u00a3250 bonus as as we won shop of the year everyone get a \u00a350 gift card. \n\nI realised I unknowingly helped destroy that family, by not even stopping to think that this is a lot of jewellery something is not right about it. The fact even if I raised that concern my manager wouldn't care less. How many other lives have I made miserable by funding habits, buying stolen precious items. The fact that I got paid extra was the turning point.\n\nI got rewarded for making people miserable. I handed in my notice on pay day and after a week said goodbye to the job and goodbye to the town as I moved 200 miles south to start a new job and live with my girlfriend.",

They both left the shop and I never saw them again as the next day I was off and there was no chance I was going into the store that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Manager was racing back to the store as this was happening and got back and was told the full story. He was so happy, we just made as a shop made 20k in profit on jewellery in one day. I was astounded that all he could think about was the money, not how me and the assistant manager were after the ordeal just how much money we made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out so did HQ. We were made the best shop of the year and my manager had a little article in the monthly newsletter. I hated myself, hated this job now as the fact we just buy anything and fund whatever, keep people in debt and be basically where the desperate go. But I still needed money so I carried on until the day before payday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our manager came to me and said good news. Because you bought all the jewellery and technically sold it all, you are getting a \u00a3250 bonus as as we won shop of the year everyone get a \u00a350 gift card. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realised I unknowingly helped destroy that family, by not even stopping to think that this is a lot of jewellery something is not right about it. The fact even if I raised that concern my manager wouldn&amp;#39;t care less. How many other lives have I made miserable by funding habits, buying stolen precious items. The fact that I got paid extra was the turning point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got rewarded for making people miserable. I handed in my notice on pay day and after a week said goodbye to the job and goodbye to the town as I moved 200 miles south to start a new job and live with my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "content": "\nso my ex boyfriend(m24) and i(f20) broke up last week, it had been many things built up over time that made me finally decide to leave him. this is my rant about a few of the things i brought up as reasons for the break up\nwe had gotten together july of 2019, we met off a dating app but instantly clicked. we had a lot in common, we grew up in the same area, had some of the same family problems, acted the same etc. we basically move in together a week after we met, it wasn\u2019t in purpose i went there one day and kinda just never left. we never had arguments, never fought never had a bad moment.  \nabout a year and a half into our relationship i start to notice things i didn\u2019t before. like how when i talked about wanting to move to another state? oh absolutely not, he would shut me down so fast and tell me how stupid of an idea that is\nor how when ever he talked about wanting kids, i always said i didn\u2019t want any. never have never will want them, but he would always tell me \u2018we\u2019re going to have kids, what do you mean?\u2019 and basically tell me i was going to have kids even tho i didn\u2019t want them\nfor 2 1/2 years years i dealt with having to put everything he wanted first. when i was feeling overwhelmed from my job because i work over 50 hours a week i couldn\u2019t talk to him about my day because it stressed him out. but he could talk about his day at his job, which wasn\u2019t actually a job it was fucking doordash when he was more than capable of having an actual job with a reliable paycheck. for 2 1/2 years he didn\u2019t have a job only doordash and then he worked at a restaurant for 5 months then quit. \ni did everything to try and make him happy, because he had a shitty childhood same as i did and i wanted to do anything i could to not make him feel like shit. i would stay up and help him fall asleep, i would wake up in the middle of the night to him shaking me cause he\u2019s having bad anxiety, i would always be there for him to rant to about his mother, when ever he had anxiety or panic attacks i was always there. i know it doesn\u2019t sound like much but it was just about every single day. i would tell him he should go to therapy and then he\u2019d get upset with me for even suggesting it\noh and sexually just to throw this in too i did my best to play on his kinks which where things i wasnt really comfortable with like me sleeping with another man or multiple men at once and him watch/record it or how he also started talking about my best friend saying she\u2019s so hot and how it would be so hot if i fucked her and sent him videos. i didn\u2019t like those, at all but he always brought them when we were having sex. but he never wanted to try any of the things i liked, choking, spanking, degrading etc the list is longer but even those simpler ones he wouldn\u2019t do or if he did it was so so soft. i would even tell him he can be rougher but he never would. but what he would do if anytime i didn\u2019t want to have sex and i\u2019d say no he would beg and plead with me to have sex and when i would say no i wasn\u2019t in the mood or no i\u2019m tired he would get all upset and wine and pout till i gave in or he\u2019d cuddle up behind me in shed and squeeze my ass or hips and whisper about how hard he was and grind up into my ass till i gave in. \ni could never hang out with friends, i would wake up around 9am get ready for work and leave about 12pm all while he\u2019s still sleeping. he wakes up between 1pm-4pm everyday then goes to door dash from6-9pm then goes to the house. i get off work around 10:30pm then i head to the house and smoke with a friend that lives 3 minutes away we talk and smoke and then i head in about 11:30(the drive to work is about 17 mins) and get a lecture about smoking with other people and how he doesn\u2019t like it taking so long. so on my off days i\u2019d try to smoke with friends then and he would still get upset cause i was smoking with friends for so long when i would be gone maybe 2 hours and it wasn\u2019t like i was smoking with other guys it was all females who he always said he never felt threatened by cause \u2018he knew i\u2019d never end up with a woman\u2019 which was dumb cause i had told him after he had asked that i think i do have a preference for women rather than men. \nhe is still, a week later calling and texting me from 10am till 4am spamming every single fucking day and it all of my social media too. my phone has been on mute, silent, do not disturb for the past week because of him. if i don\u2019t respond he threatens to come to where i live or work and see if i\u2019m there. he says it cause he\u2019s worried about me but i know he\u2019s just paranoid about me having relationships that aren\u2019t him. not even romantic relations just normal fuckin friends. he even came to my work and sat outside for over 7 hours waiting for me one night just cause he wanted to talk but how that talk went was him holding onto my car begging me not to leave and then when i do drive off he scream that he\u2019s \u2018going to fucking kill himself without me\u2019 then he punches his truck and breaks two fingers\ni\u2019ve told him all of this, many many times but he doesn\u2019t seem to understand that i\u2019m so done. i tried to talk to him when we were still together about how i was feeling and express that i didn\u2019t like certain things but he always kept doing them. he never seemed to remember the things i didn\u2019t like. \nhe told me i couldn\u2019t just leave like that, that this isn\u2019t the way i\u2019m suppose to handle adult relationship then proceeds to say \u2018i\u2019m glad i was just a place holder for you just like every other woman ive been with\u2019\n\nlike this wasn\u2019t fucking easy for me are you kidding me? this has been my longest relationship and i did really really love him but at some point i just started falling out of love and i knew i had to end it. maybe that is selfish maybe i am selfish but i feel like i shouldn\u2019t dread going to the house and seeing him once i\u2019m off work. \n\nbut here\u2019s my rant, feel free to ask any questions or comment any opinions i\u2019ll respond to people when i\u2019m able to",

I\u2019m gathering interest for an r/anime rewatch of *The Demon Girl Next Door* (Machikado Mazoku), A fast-paced comedy show from two and a half years ago that has a sequel coming out next season!\n\nIt features the [most precious demon girl](https://i.imgur.com/UkzCMGU.jpg) you\u2019ll ever meet, ~~Shadow Mistress Yuuko~~ Shamiko, being given the task to murderize a Magical Girl to lift a curse of poverty and misfortune on Shamiko\u2019s family. The problem? Shamiko is frail and hopelessly incapable of doing anything that could be defined as evil, and the Magical Girl she\u2019s been tasked to defeat is crazy strong! Yuri-tones and comedy ensues as Shamiko continues her plot despite her circumstances and the uphill battle ahead of her.\n\nThis show [has a WT!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/d7c13n/wt_ganbare_shamiko_why_you_should_be_watching/) If you\u2019re not sold yet and would like to read more. I will just say, that unlike a typical cute girls show, this one has more depth than initially appears. If you\u2019re enjoying this season\u2019s *Slow Loop*, or if you\u2019ve enjoyed *New Game!*, *Hitoribocchi no Marumaruseikatsu*, or *Is the Order a Rabbit?* already, the chance you will enjoy this show as well is close to 100%.\n\n**Where to Watch**\n\n*The Demon Girl Next Door* is available both subbed and dubbed on [HIDIVE](https://www.hidive.com/tv/the-demon-girl-next-door?q=the+demon+girl+next+door). You can use their 14-day Free Trial to watch it with us if you\u2019d like! Sentai has also put out a physical release.\n\n**Scheduling**\n\nIf enough interest is shown, the plan is to start on **7:00PM EST Feb. 16th** with daily posting until Feb. 27th. An announcement thread will be made with more details next week if enough interest is shown.\n\n**More Info**\n\n[Anilist](https://anilist.co/anime/107490/The-Demon-Girl-Next-Door/) | [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39071/Machikado_Mazoku?q=the%20demon%20girl%20next%20door&amp;cat=anime) | [ANN](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=22008)\n\nPlease leave a comment if you are interested.",

    "content": "Hey everyone. I\u2019m currently doing a monthly series on /r/Baseball where I present a baseball show to the community. Since those are basically WT! Posts, I wanted to also cross-post them here so they go into the archive.\n\nPrevious Installments:\n\n* [Ace of the Diamond](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/olf0li/the_baseball_anime_guide_ace_of_the_diamond/)\n* [Battery](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/q6j0pq/the_baseball_anime_guide_battery/)\n* [Gurazeni](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/p3mleu/the_baseball_anime_guide_gurazeni/)\n* [One Outs](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/pnavhc/the_baseball_anime_guide_one_outs/)\n* [Princess Nine](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/rfcg5f/the_baseball_anime_guide_princess_nine/?)\n* [Touch](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/qqqwgw/the_baseball_anime_guide_touch/)\n\n\n\n---------\n\nIn my review of Princess Nine last month I wrote about how a series filled with female characters would be targeted at a male audience today to market it on character appeal and catch the otaku-crowd. This is a rather standard practice nowadays, and to illustrate this, let\u2019s take a look at a modern show about women\u2019s baseball.\n\n**Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine** (The Cinderella Nine of August, or just Cinderella Nine for short) is based on a mobile game where you play a very rudimentary version of baseball with anime girls. Unfortunately, while those avatars are appealing on a basic graphic level, they are only provided a very rudimentary characterization that is full of tropes, which is also true in the anime.\n\nThe main character is Tsubasa Arihara, a high school freshman who wants to start her own hardball baseball club in her new school which doesn\u2019t even have a boys club. As such she has to recruit team members, find space to practice in and organize games. This unfortunately makes the show sound more interesting than it is, as even the hardships they do encounter with a newly organized team are relatively quickly overcome. The show suffers generally from an abrupt format where new plot elements and characters are quickly introduced and not given a lot of time to develop properly.\n\nThis leads to plotlines like a fight between two characters happening and their reconciliation in the same episode, with neither the set-up nor the resolution given enough room to breathe. Due to the short length of the series at only twelve episodes this could be somewhat excused, but I have seen a lot of shows which were much better structured with the same number of episodes to work with. It\u2019s not that the writing is outright atrocious, and considering that the show is based on a free to play mobile game it actually kind of exceeds expectations. It just lacks any real depth. It is perfectly inoffensive and I guess something you can watch in between other things.\n\nUnfortunately, given the nature of this property there are other issues such as over-design of the characters and uniforms in the series. Given that the attractiveness of the girls is the major selling point of both the show and the game it is based on, they have various hairstyles and accessories that are meant to further their appeal and characterization, but that make no sense to have on a baseball field. One player for some bizarre reason has cat-ears attached to her cap, and the uniforms are some weird amalgam of a regular baseball uniform and a sailor-style girl\u2019s school uniform (and a rival team has an even stranger design). I think the biggest offender is the weird, heeled booties that they wear instead of regular baseball cleats. And that from a show that goes out of its way to explain proper glove maintenance. At least there isn\u2019t any overt sexualization of the characters.\n\nThe baseball subgenre in manga and anime is surprisingly deep and rich, but unfortunately not every series can be a winner. I think it is a bit of a waste as the setup of a girls hardball club team could have been rather promising, and we already saw an excellent example of it working in Princess Nine. Cinderella Nine on the other hand kneecapped by its very commercial nature. It isn't outright bad, but it just isn't very good either.\n\n------------------\n\nAlternate Titles: Cinderella Nine, \u516b\u6708\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30c7\u30ec\u30e9\u30ca\u30a4\u30f3, Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine\n\n[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38091/Hachigatsu_no_Cinderella_Nine_TV?q=cinderella%20nine&amp;cat=anime) - [ANN](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=21671)\n\nStudio: TMS Entertainment\n\nLength: 12 Episodes\n\nOriginal Air Date: April 7, 2019 \u2013 July 7, 2019",

Superstonk is a very important place to a lot of folks, myself included, and part of that relates to the civil conversations I'm so fond of finding. Like most things that are important to me, I recognize change is inevitable if the relationship is strong and long enough. So, to that end, I am here soliciting opinions.\n\nWe have already seen that we are stronger together. That by sharing a common goal, individuals can have an impact large enough to shake the very foundations of \"the system\" which runs the world. Superstonk, to me, is a proving ground for the power and beauty of decentralization of knowledge, education, and humor, all of which stem from a desire to see a better reality for ourselves and each other. When this sub is humming with creative energy and love for the fellow ape, it is truly something to behold.\n\nI believe that if we are to continue to grow and improve as individuals, and as a sub, we need to be open to criticism, but mindful of boundaries. We should be kind to each other and to ourselves. Willing to listen to understand, not just to respond. I've seen the best and worst this sub has had to offer over the course of my modship (Holy shit has it really been almost 8 months?!) and I honestly feel like one of the big failures of the past was not gathering sentiment directly from the community with pointed questions.\n\nMy job, as I see it, is to make this place as fun and fair and Super as possible. What does that look like to you, dear ape reading this? Should the rules be rewritten? The sub description? Maybe you think we should limit posts per user per day or open flair up so users can change it any time? Maybe you like Superstonk how it is? Do you want a discord? How about karma requirements? Too high, too low? Are mods too lenient? Too harsh? Does it even seem like we exist except to cause drama? Maybe you want to be a mod? Does the banner need changed? How about the color scheme? More community awards? Contests?\n\nANYTHING you can think of to leave feedback on, I want to hear it so I can make sure the rest of the team does too. I'm thinking like a giant comment card scenario.\n\nThe point is, I can't know for sure unless I ask. Directly. Like this. Otherwise I'm basically just a humanbot scanning for sentiment. And I hate that thought because I love people. Please help me take Superstonk into the new year with all the ways you think this community could be improved.\n\nThank you in advance for your feedback, and apologies if I don't respond. I'm in the middle of getting ready for a move 2 weeks out so my free time is limited. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19\n\nETA: even if I don't respond, please know I am taking every single comment here back to the team for review.\n\nETA2: for those who do not meet the karma/age requirements to comment, please feel free to add your thoughts here anyhow. As a moderator, I can still view them.\n\nETA3: DRS guide link added.\n\nETA4: I asked for this to be pinned so we could get more feedback from the community, since I posted over the weekend.

Apollo Advisors, which would later become...\n\n**&gt;&gt; APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT &lt;&lt;**\n\n(The Irony of a Company Called Apollo being at the center of this? Moon Simulation Much?)\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOW...\n\nLeon Black had risen through the ranks at Drexel to become **Michael Milken's Right-Hand Man**, and built a fearsome reputation doing so.\n\n[Source - Time Magazine: Paragraph 6](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,137095,00.html)\n\nThis reputation meant within 6 months, Apollo Advisors had managed to raise **$400 million** and launched their first fund. **Apollo 1.**\n\nAs you can imagine... after all he had learned from Milken, it didn't take Black long to start some fuckery.\n\nLet's Take a look at one of his **FIRST** deals shall we?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Leon Black and Michael Milken](https://preview.redd.it/53p76jh819b81.png?width=509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9501a7627f3f4a761ccf62d1469dee95998fff8)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Adam Aron (Yes POPCORN Adam Aron!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Adam Aron CEO of Vail Resorts](https://preview.redd.it/khgpm65019b81.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=027c8b36b71fc475c902b6052f118282aca91f10)\n\nIn the 1980's George Gillett was building a billion-dollar empire based on the odd combination of meatpacking and television stations, in addition to **Vail Mountain**, much of which was financed by the **Junk Bonds of Drexel.**\n\nThis all came crashing down in 1991 when Gillett **couldn't pay off the debt** on the notes from Milken. Gillett Holdings filed for **Chapter 11 Bankruptcy** and Apollo swooped in and became the majority shareholder by 1992.\n\nBlack quickly began selling off much of the Assets held by Gillett Holdings but kept **Vail Resorts** as part of his Apollo Ski Partners Division.\n\nWhile under the management of Gillett, the Vail Resorts thrived, winning Ski Magazine rankings 5 years in a row, in addition to completing the China Bowl and Mongolia Bowls expansion and bringing the World Championships to Vail for the first time.\n\n(I've no idea what this means, but needless to see they were doing well and the operation was ticking along nicely)\n\nFrom 1996 to 2006, Aron was **HIRED BY APOLLO** as CEO to oversee their investment in Vail Resorts.\n\nSource: [https://www.perenews.com/apollo-hires-ex-vail-ceo-as-operating-partner/](https://www.perenews.com/apollo-hires-ex-vail-ceo-as-operating-partner/) (Paragraph 2)\n\nThough it's widely claimed that Apollo Management sold their stake in Vail in **2003**, according to their **SEC filings,** this didn't happen until **2004**.\n\n&gt;*Apollo Management, headed by Leon Black, bought the company out of bankruptcy and took Vail Resorts public, controlling Vail Resorts through its growth* ***until around 2003***\\*, when Apollo divested themselves of the controlling interest.\\*\n\nWikipedia Claiming they left in 2003 [Source Paragraph \"History\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vail_Resorts)\n\nSEC forms showing Sales of Ownership:\n\n[SEC Form 4 #1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812011/000092153004000196/xslF345X02/primary_doc.xml)\n\n[SEC Form 4 #2](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812011/000095016204001126/xslF345X02/apolloskiform4093004_ex.xml)\n\n[Sec Form 4 #3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812011/000092153004000536/xslF345X02/edgar.xml)\n\nWith the last recorded date of ownership being **5th November 2004.**\n\nANYWAY...\n\nIt wasn't long thereafter that Aron decided he was **going to jump ship** too.\n\nIn 2006 he **shocked** everyone by announcing he was quitting, but not before cashing in all his shares of course.\n\n[Source The Denver Post](https://www.denverpost.com/2006/01/30/vail-resorts-chief-quitting/)\n\nIt's again... widely reported that Adam Aron did a **GREAT job at Vail**.\n\nEverywhere you go, from his BIOs to Popcorn Apes raving about their Silverback, they quote the stock price of the company while under Aron's control, or how the business expanded, or how profits were up...\n\nBut there's another side to this story.\n\n**Aron's loyalties lie with Apollo, nobody else.**\n\nAnd Apollo's priority is profits no matter what the cost.\n\nHere's an article in 1998 by **Forbes Magazine**, that describes how Aron went about **\"extracting extra bucks out of the existing lift-ticket buyers,\"**\n\nHe uses strategies that ensure all visitors' money is spent at the resort itself.  And this worked very well. He built restaurants, hotels, even a credit card that ensured Skier Dollars were only spent within Vail Resorts.\n\nThis came at a **MASSIVE** cost to local businesses though. Many of which suffered, or completely went out of business.\n\nAron's justification for the number of complaints he got from stealing local business? **\"Sour Grapes\"**\n\nHe never tried to ease people's minds, or assure them of his intentions and plans for the future.\n\nSource: [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1998/1019/6209070a.html?sh=1be464302a78)\n\nBut after the penny pinching, and taking the company Public (Followed by **7 Years of Stock Price Declines**) the stock started to finally turn around.\n\nAnd Aron started to build a reputation in the community (Apparently) that he and Apollo were **not the bad guys after all.**\n\n**IN FACT**... almost everywhere you read about Aron's time at Vail, it's **HAILED** as a massive success story!\n\nAnd he certainly gave the impression that he was **ALL IN ON VAIL!**\n\nAdam Commits to Vail, including selling stock options to \"acquire a new residence in Vail for his **long-term** personal use\"\n\nThis move was intended to show **\"I trust I am expressing both my strong confidence and commitment here\"**\n\nAnnounced **1 year** before he surprised everyone by Quitting and going to work for Apollo\n\n(At the time, he did not tell anyone his plans to work for Apollo)\n\n[Source Vail Daily](https://www.vaildaily.com/news/vail-ceo-aron-to-sell-stock-options/)\n\nIn saying all this... by the time Aron was DONE in Vail, profits were up, the stock price was up, the company had expanded and overall there was more money available to locals through various investments in the town and its people. (Apparently)\n\nSo everyone wins right?\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell, I personally think **A LOT** more went on here, but it's way beyond my smooth brain to comprehend.\n\nIn the 1996 Annual Report, there are 44 Mentions of Apollo\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812011/0000927356-96-001229.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812011/0000927356-96-001229.txt)\n\nIn the 1997 Annual Report, there are 8 mentions of Apollo\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812011/0000927356-97-001483.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812011/0000927356-97-001483.txt)\n\nIn the 1998 Annual Report, there is 1 mention of Apollo\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812011/0000927356-98-001712.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812011/0000927356-98-001712.txt)\n\n1999 Annual Report, there is 3 mentions of Apollo\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812011/000092735699001663/0000927356-99-001663.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812011/000092735699001663/0000927356-99-001663.txt)\n\nThen no Annual Report until 2002 - with 3 mentions of Apollo\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000812011/000081201102000016/vrifyo1form10ka.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000812011/000081201102000016/vrifyo1form10ka.htm)\n\nOk I'm getting into the weeds a bit I know...\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBUT...\n\nWhen you look back at the point in time when Apollo Actually DID Dissolve their ownership... things take a **SLIGHTLY** different tone.\n\nIn this article in the Deseret News discussing the move... the quote that, even though the stock was up, Revenue was up, and expansion was secure and even the Ski Lift ticket prices had been raised to the **HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY**... the company was actually losing money year over year?\n\n&gt;Separately, Vail Resorts reported a **loss of $36.3 million**, or $1.03 a share, for the fourth quarter ended July 4, **wider than the loss a year ago of $33.7 million**, or 96 cents a share.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Revenue for the latest quarter rose 4.2 percent to $83.1 million from $79.7 million.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the full fiscal year, **Vail Resorts lost $5.9 million**, or 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of $8.5 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Full-year revenue rose to $500.4 million from $464.1 million.\n\nAdditionally, this article discusses:\n\n&gt;CEO Aron said reports in the media about the possible sale of the company were \"inaccurate\" and some of the \"sources in the stories were either stupid . . . or making things up.\"\n\nFollowing this, The Denver Post reported (No source as they were not online yet) that indeed Vail Resorts was Courting Buyers interested in **acquiring the company** for about $725 million.\n\nAron said he couldn't elaborate because his **lawyer advised him not to comment** on market speculation.\n\n&gt;\"I've said it as clearly as I can \u2014 the management team and everyone in the company is focused on operating the business,\" Aron said.\n\nSource: [https://www.deseret.com/2004/10/1/19853332/apollo-dissolves-vail-resorts-stake](https://www.deseret.com/2004/10/1/19853332/apollo-dissolves-vail-resorts-stake)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother Article from around that time... in the Dever Business Journal, discusses how not only was Apollo selling its **1.3 million shares** in the company, but the company would also withdraw a shelf registration to sell another **175,000 shares** to Apollo Ski partners (Owned by Apollo Global)\n\nAnd also references the losses the company was making.\n\nSource: [https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2004/03/29/daily34.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2004/03/29/daily34.html)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow about we take a look at how the **LOCALS REALLY FELT**??\n\n&gt;As far as on the mountain skiing experience, where the hell have you been skiing? The market is overrun by discount, down-market bargain hunters who are squeezing out our alpha customer to the detriment of every business in town. Prices are so easily cut and so easy to raise that Vail Resorts profit margins are shrinking faster than a porn star in an ice cold bath. Unfortunately, many of us have assets here in the valley that are negatively affected by Aron\u2019s ineptitude.\n\nSource [VailDaily](https://www.vaildaily.com/news/tipsline-141/)\n\n&gt;Hey I\u2019m just calling to see what the other Vail Resorts employees think of Adam Aron\u2019s big bonus. We keep having these record years, and he can only muster a 2 percent raise for the last three years? That doesn\u2019t even cover our insurance going up. We\u2019re still losing money. He always talks about how valuable his employees are, and the locals are. How about a little respect? I agree with Gonzalo of the Minturn militia. If you keep messing with the local work force, hopefully, Adam, you will be moving on to greener pastures, like you deny. Pretty much you\u2019re no good for this community or Vail Resorts. Beat it, chump.\n\nSource [VailDaily](https://www.vaildaily.com/news/tipsline-110/)\n\n&gt;I personally feel that as a community we afford Vail Resorts many privileges to bring business into the valley, widening the Frontage Road and opening Ford Park to allow for overflow parking.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We developed a master plan for the village and Lionshead with VR\u2019s redevelopment in mind. Yet the more we give the less we receive as a community.\n\nSource [VailDaily](https://www.vaildaily.com/news/letters-to-the-editor-238/)\n\n&gt;Never mind the visitors  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I think it really stinks that Vail Resorts doesn\u2019t let the locals ski until Sunday the 3rd. We used to be able to ski on the first of January. Kaye Ferry is right. The merchant pass prices have gone up and we have less skiable days.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Worthy of investigation\n\nSource [VailDaily](https://www.vaildaily.com/news/tipsline-159/)\n\n&gt;I would just like to comment on tattling where the individual here is talking about Adam Aron being parked in a handicapped spot on Christmas day, because the editor\u2019s note here says that Vail Resorts\u2019 CEO Adam Aron has had a foot injury requiring the use of crutches and a wheelchair. Miraculously, on the 27th, I saw Adam Aron at a party where he did not require either a wheelchair or crutches, so I\u2019m not really sure what you guys are up to, but that\u2019s a miraculous recovery in two days from a wheelchair and crutches to partying down on the 27th of December. Thanks for all of your investigative reporting.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No excuses\n\nSource [VailDaily](https://www.vaildaily.com/news/tipsline-159/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeriously... there is a shit ton of this stuff. You Apes should take a browse if you want to get a REAL feel of how the locals viewed Aron.\n\nSome of it is hilarious... but a lot of it highlights how **poorly employees were treated**, how locals ski access was continuously abused in favor of higher profit tourist ski, how the town has suffered financially, and how generally... very little good will seemed to have ACTUALLY been directed at Aron, despite what all the MSM and Experts say...\n\nAnd remember Aron's response to this???? \"Sour Grapes\"\n\nAll in the name of better profits for Apollo\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In regards to the tattling on CEO Adam Aron. I was the tattler, and Mr. Aron was actually running to his car avoiding the snowflakes that were coming down in the parking lot at Safeway. So I don\u2019t normally bash others, but you guys need to get things straight before you start printing stuff.\n\nLMAYO\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo does this mean that Adam Aron was doing a bad job as \"INSIDE MAN\" for Apollo?\n\nWell I went and checked...\n\nAnd in FACT, he was doing a great job for them!\n\nThe company was not losing money at all.\n\nEvery Year, from 1996 - 2006, the company was profitable!\n\nWITH THE EXCEPTION OF 2...\n\n2003 - 2004... right around when Apollo decided to up and leave.\n\nI WONDER why that might be?\n\nIf you want to check out all years, you can go to SECs Edgar search results here, and just click on Annual Reports and search for Net Income.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=812011&amp;owner=exclude](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=812011&amp;owner=exclude)\n\nBut here's a quick snapshot from 2006 Annual report highlighting the 2 losses:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uhagbv2s7xa81.png?width=1294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60a50192c6023b1add33e43b520a38b1fa8d0127\n\nNow to be fair... after Apollo had dissolved their position, Aron did bring the company right back to profitability making $23 million in 2005.\n\nAnd though he can only be credited for half of 2006, from that point on (After Aron left) the companies profits soared.\n\nBy 2008, Company **profits had increased by 400%** of Arons last full year.\n\nSource: SEC [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000812011/000081201108000026/form10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000812011/000081201108000026/form10k.htm)\n\n(Search for Net Income to see a 5-year snapshot)\n\nSo whether or not you consider this doing a good job... is still up to you.

And this worked very well. He built restaurants, hotels, even a credit card that ensured Skier Dollars were only spent within Vail Resorts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This came at a &lt;strong&gt;MASSIVE&lt;/strong&gt; cost to local businesses though.

different tone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this article in the Deseret News discussing the move... the quote that, even though the stock was up, Revenue was up, and expansion was secure and even the Ski Lift ticket prices had been raised to the &lt;strong&gt;HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY&lt;/strong&gt;... the company was actually losing money year over year?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Separately, Vail Resorts reported a &lt;strong&gt;loss of $36.3 million&lt;/strong&gt;, or $1.03 a share, for the fourth quarter ended July 4, &lt;strong&gt;wider than the loss a year ago of $33.7 million&lt;/strong&gt;, or 96 cents a share.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Revenue for the latest quarter rose 4.2 percent to $83.1 million from $79.7 million.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the full fiscal year, &lt;strong&gt;Vail Resorts lost $5.9 million&lt;/strong&gt;, or 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of $8.5 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Full-year revenue rose to $500.4 million from $464.1 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this article discusses:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CEO Aron said reports in the media about the possible sale of the company were &amp;quot;inaccurate&amp;quot; and some of the &amp;quot;sources in the stories were either stupid . . . or making things up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following this, The Denver Post reported (No source as they were not online yet) that indeed Vail Resorts was Courting Buyers interested in &lt;strong&gt;acquiring the company&lt;/strong&gt; for about $725 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aron said he couldn&amp;#39;t elaborate because his &lt;strong&gt;lawyer advised him not to comment&lt;/strong&gt; on market speculation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve said it as clearly as I can \u2014 the management team and everyone in the company is focused on operating the business,&amp;quot;

The market is overrun by discount, down-market bargain hunters who are squeezing out our alpha customer to the detriment of every business in town. Prices are so easily cut and so easy to raise that Vail Resorts profit margins are shrinking faster than a porn star in an ice cold bath. Unfortunately, many of us have assets here in the valley that are negatively affected by Aron\u2019s ineptitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source &lt;a href=\"https://www.vaildaily.com/news/tipsline-141/\"&gt;VailDaily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hey I\u2019m just calling to see what the other Vail Resorts employees think of Adam Aron\u2019s big bonus. We keep having these record years, and he can only muster a 2 percent raise for the last three years? That doesn\u2019t even cover our insurance going up. We\u2019re still losing money. He always talks about how valuable his employees are, and the locals are. How about a little respect? I agree with Gonzalo of the Minturn militia. If you keep messing with the local work force, hopefully, Adam, you will be moving on to greener pastures, like you deny. Pretty much you\u2019re no good for this community or Vail Resorts.

We used to be able to ski on the first of January. Kaye Ferry is right. The merchant pass prices have gone up and we have less skiable days.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worthy of investigation&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source &lt;a href=\"https://www.vaildaily.com/news/tipsline-159/\"&gt;VailDaily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would just like to comment on tattling where the individual here is talking about Adam Aron being parked in a handicapped spot on Christmas day, because the editor\u2019s note here says that Vail Resorts\u2019 CEO Adam Aron has had a foot injury requiring the use of crutches and a wheelchair. Miraculously, on the 27th, I saw Adam Aron at a party where he did not require either a wheelchair or crutches, so I\u2019m not really sure what you guys are up to, but that\u2019s a miraculous recovery in two days from a wheelchair and crutches to partying down on the 27th of December. Thanks for all of your investigative reporting.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No excuses&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source &lt;a href=\"https://www.vaildaily.com/news/tipsline-159/\"&gt;VailDaily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously... there is a shit ton of this stuff. You Apes should take a browse if you want to get a REAL feel of how the locals viewed Aron.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of it is hilarious... but a lot of it highlights how &lt;strong&gt;poorly employees were treated&lt;/strong&gt;, how locals ski access was continuously abused in favor of higher profit tourist ski, how the town has suffered financially, and how generally... very little good will seemed to have ACTUALLY been directed at Aron, despite what all the MSM and Experts say...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And remember Aron&amp;#39;s response to this???? &amp;quot;Sour Grapes&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in the name of better profits for Apollo&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In regards to the tattling on CEO Adam Aron. I was the tattler, and Mr. Aron was actually running to his car avoiding the snowflakes that were coming down in the parking lot at Safeway. So I don\u2019t normally bash others, but you guys need to get things straight before you start printing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LMAYO&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So does this mean that Adam Aron was doing a bad job as &amp;quot;INSIDE MAN&amp;quot; for Apollo?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well I went and checked...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in FACT, he was doing a great job for them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The company was not losing money at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every Year, from 1996 - 2006, the company was profitable!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 2...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2003 - 2004... right around when Apollo decided to up and leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I WONDER why that might be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to check out all years, you can go to SECs Edgar search results here, and just click on Annual Reports and search for Net Income.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=812011&amp;amp;owner=exclude\"&gt;https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=812011&amp;amp;owner=exclude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s a quick snapshot from 2006 Annual report highlighting the 2 losses:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uhagbv2s7xa81.png?width=1294&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=60a50192c6023b1add33e43b520a38b1fa8d0127\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/uhagbv2s7xa81.png?width=1294&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=60a50192c6023b1add33e43b520a38b1fa8d0127&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to be fair... after Apollo had dissolved their position, Aron did bring the company right back to profitability making $23 million in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And though he can only be credited for half of 2006, from that point on (After Aron left) the companies profits soared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By 2008, Company &lt;strong&gt;profits had increased by 400%&lt;/strong&gt; of Arons last full year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: SEC &lt;a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000812011/000081201108000026/form10k.htm\"&gt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000812011/000081201108000026/form10k.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Search for Net Income to see a 5-year snapshot)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So whether or not you consider this doing a good job... is still up to you.

The Company remains in long-term secular decline due to its apparent unwillingness to pivot with urgency and grow with gamers. As evidence, stockholders have seen the value of their equity decline by nearly 68% over the past three years and decline by nearly 85% over the past five years. 2 GameStop is also one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market, which speaks volumes about investors\u2019 lack of confidence in the current leadership team\u2019s approach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It is equally important to stressthat GameStop hasfailed to adequately keep pace with key industry developments in recent years, including:\n\n* The transition from physical hardware to digital streaming.\n* The explosion of mobile.\n* The shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors.\n\n&gt;By not capitalizing on these shifts, GameStop has lost billions of dollars in annual revenue and squandered a massive amount of market share. The Board cannot run from the following facts:\n\n* Sales have plunged from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019.\n* Annual EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to only $111 million in fiscal year 2019.\n* Net income has fallen off a cliff from $339 million in fiscal year 2011 to a staggering loss of $470 million in fiscal year 2019.\n* In the two most recent quarters alone, the Company has lost another $277 million.\n* To add insult to injury for GameStop\u2019s stockholders, the size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle.\n\n&gt;Although GameStop\u2019s e-commerce sales have increased significantly during the pandemic, annual revenues have declined by a staggering margin over time. The next console cycle\u2019s temporary sales bump is not a justification for complacency and glacial transformation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;RC Ventures understands that Chief Executive Officer George Sherman has substantial experience working for large brick-and-mortar retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, Best Buy and Target. Regrettably, Mr. Sherman appears committed to a twentieth-century focus on physical stores and walk-in sales despite the transition to an always-on digital world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Through our private conversations, we have explained to Mr. Sherman and the Board that GameStop has the ability to pivot toward becoming a technology-driven business that excels in the gaming and digital experience worlds. But this pivot requires the type of strategic vision that has not yet taken hold in the c-suite or boardroom of the company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We contend the Company\u2019s sales should be growing at least in line with the market \u2013 not going in the opposite direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**WE URGE GAMESTOP TO ADOPT THE RIGHT ROADMAP TO VALUE CREATION NOW**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We have stopped short of outlining a detailed turnaround plan in this correspondence because the onus is on the Board and Mr. Sherman to do their jobs and produce a viable strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Please be advised that RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop\u2019s ten-member Board. It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability. We want GameStop\u2019s leaders to do their jobs and implement a strategy for bringing the Company into the 21st century.\n\nSOURCE:[ SEC Archives](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf)\n\nOk... so to me, this isn't just frustration with stock/investment performance. This is addressing the **CLEAR** **MISMANAGEMENT** of the company.\n\nAnd after stating that they ***\"devoted a significant amount of time to analyzing GameStop\u2019s assets, balance sheet, corporate governance, opportunity set and positioning within the sector\"***  I very much DOUBT that RC didn't do a background check on the leadership team.\n\nAnd as soon as he got his foot in the door... he began immediately removing the bad Apples.\n\nMakes sense right?\n\nThis is me speculating of course because I have no idea what goes on in that beautiful brain of his... but to me... this letter shows that he tried talking to them... he tried explaining it to them... but he couldn't just stand by and watch them drive the company into the ground like the **Private Equity Firm Hostile Takeover Playbook** would have done.\n\nSo he said **FUCK IT...

I can&amp;#39;t even make sense of this shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his LINKEDIN... listed above... he shows his career path from 1996... to Gamestop...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But remember in his investment Page... he listed a whole heap of other shit...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He previously served as non-executive Chairman of the Board of Rexnord Corporation (NYSE: RXN).   During his tenure, Rexnord was a portfolio company of both Apollo Management and The Carlyle Group prior to its listing on the NYSE in 2012.   George retired from his role as Chairman of the Board of Rexnord Corporation in July 2015.

I did a little Digging... and &lt;strong&gt;SURE ENOUGH&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an Official Press Release by Campbells Soups stating that Georgey is being made Chairman of the Board...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is in June 2001...

The Company remains in long-term secular decline due to its apparent unwillingness to pivot with urgency and grow with gamers. As evidence, stockholders have seen the value of their equity decline by nearly 68% over the past three years and decline by nearly 85% over the past five years. 2 GameStop is also one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market, which speaks volumes about investors\u2019 lack of confidence in the current leadership team\u2019s approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is equally important to stressthat GameStop hasfailed to adequately keep pace with key industry developments in recent years, including:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The transition from physical hardware to digital streaming.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The explosion of mobile.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By not capitalizing on these shifts, GameStop has lost billions of dollars in annual revenue and squandered a massive amount of market share. The Board cannot run from the following facts:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sales have plunged from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Annual EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to only $111 million in fiscal year 2019.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Net income has fallen off a cliff from $339 million in fiscal year 2011 to a staggering loss of $470 million in fiscal year 2019.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the two most recent quarters alone, the Company has lost another $277 million.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To add insult to injury for GameStop\u2019s stockholders, the size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although GameStop\u2019s e-commerce sales have increased significantly during the pandemic, annual revenues have declined by a staggering margin over time. The next console cycle\u2019s temporary sales bump is not a justification for complacency and glacial transformation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;RC Ventures understands that Chief Executive Officer George Sherman has substantial experience working for large brick-and-mortar retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, Best Buy and Target. Regrettably, Mr. Sherman appears committed to a twentieth-century focus on physical stores and walk-in sales despite the transition to an always-on digital world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Through our private conversations, we have explained to Mr. Sherman and the Board that GameStop has the ability to pivot toward becoming a technology-driven business that excels in the gaming and digital experience worlds. But this pivot requires the type of strategic vision that has not yet taken hold in the c-suite or boardroom of the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We contend the Company\u2019s sales should be growing at least in line with the market \u2013 not going in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WE URGE GAMESTOP TO ADOPT THE RIGHT ROADMAP TO VALUE CREATION NOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have stopped short of outlining a detailed turnaround plan in this correspondence because the onus is on the Board and Mr. Sherman to do their jobs and produce a viable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please be advised that RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop\u2019s ten-member Board. It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability. We want GameStop\u2019s leaders to do their jobs and implement a strategy for bringing the Company into the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SOURCE:&lt;a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf\"&gt; SEC Archives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok... so to me, this isn&amp;#39;t just frustration with stock/investment performance. This is addressing the &lt;strong&gt;CLEAR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;MISMANAGEMENT&lt;/strong&gt; of the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And after stating that they &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;devoted a significant amount of time to analyzing GameStop\u2019s assets, balance sheet, corporate governance, opportunity set and positioning within the sector&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  I very much DOUBT that RC didn&amp;#39;t do a background check on the leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as soon as he got his foot in the door... he began immediately removing the bad Apples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Makes sense right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is me speculating of course because I have no idea what goes on in that beautiful brain of his... but to me... this letter shows that he tried talking to them... he tried explaining it to them... but he couldn&amp;#39;t just stand by and watch them drive the company into the ground like the &lt;strong&gt;Private Equity Firm Hostile Takeover Playbook&lt;/strong&gt; would have done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he said &lt;strong&gt;FUCK IT... I&amp;#39;ll DO IT MYSELF!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok...

    "content": "Welcome to the first ever week 18 of the official r/NFL Power Rankings! We'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone contributing to these weekly rankings, whether ranking, reading, or commenting. As the regular season comes to a close, will this list be nothing more than a glorified playoff bracket? Where will teams like the Colts land, after falling asleep before the finish line? Does a loss to the ever-hungry Lions knock the Packers off the top spot? What does a sweep to San Fransisco mean for the Rams? Discuss! [30/32 reporting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTRFy5Vb0-4MubRy5rOfEyUU64GZ48oRedmD9MDIZhX8ZPWV4FBM9wJ-qYFWbLud22pLSchLGcks4d8/pubhtml?gid=369154607&amp;single=true) \n\n\\#||Team|\u0394|Record|Comment\t\t\t\t\t\t\n--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1.\t| [](/GB) | Packers | \t--\t|\t13-4\t|\tThe Manningcast curse strikes again I suppose! The Rodgers unit left the game with a slight defecit and the Jordan Love unit wasn't quite able to complete the comeback. The important thing is nobody suffered any series injury.Shoutout to David Bakhtiari for playing last week, really happy to see him out there playing again. Next week all four NFC North teams are off, but unlike the others the Packers await their Divisional Round opponent.\n2.\t| [](/TB) | Buccaneers | \t--\t|\t13-4\t|\tThanks to the magic of Jimmy Garoppolo and the San Francisco 49ers, the Buccaneers sneaked into the #2 seed in the NFC. The Buccaneers swept the Panthers with a 41-17 blowout led by 300+ passing yards from Brady (with 3 TD's) and 2 takeaways from the defense. The Bucs will play the Eagles at home in the 2021 Super Wildcard Weekend. Fans are hoping that playoff Devin White will appear-- you know, the one who had 38 tackles, 2 fumble recoveries, 2 INT's, and 2 PD's last year. Instead of the regular season Devin White who continues to look like he eats paint chips as a pastime. \n3.\t| [](/KC) | Chiefs | \t--\t|\t12-5\t|\tA nailbiter against the Broncos does not inspire too much confidence for the Chiefs heading into the playoffs, but the last game the starters played last year was a awful 17-14 win against the Falcons so maybe it is not an idicator of things to come. Regardless, thanks to the Jags the Chiefs will play the Steelers in round one of the playoffs which is the best matchup they could hope for. It is time for the Chiefs to lean on their playoff experience and try to make the Super Bowl for the third straight year, this time as a wild card team. \n4.\t| [](/TEN) | Titans | \t+3\t|\t12-5\t|\tThe Titans took care of business against the Texans on Sunday and wrapped up the #1 seed in the AFC and a bye week before the Divisional round.  [The Titans became the 1st team in NFL history to record at least 8 wins against teams with a winning record at the end of the year](https://twitter.com/MikeMiracles/status/1480584656395415571)\n5.\t| [](/DAL) | Cowboys | \t+1\t|\t12-5\t|\tThis was treated like the last night of the season for a High School team. Go out there, break a couple record, and then let the JC kids share the spotlight. Dak is the new franchise TD holder, the team set the league record for most individual players to find the end zone, Zeke's cousin got to score, and drafting Ito Smith in a dynasty league finally paid off. Most importantly, the team is rolling hot into the playoffs.\n6.\t| [](/BUF) | Bills | \t-1\t|\t11-6\t|\tThe Bills once again had to contend with bad weather at home, with some wild winds slowing down the passing attack, shortening punts, and making field goals nearly impossible for the team driving into it. Despite that, the Bills out-gained the Jets by an astonishing 371 yards in the 27-10 win, and in turn, secured the AFC East for the second year in a row. This marks the first time they\u2019ve done that since a run of four straight between \u201888 and \u201891, and the first time they were able to secure it at home since 1995. They\u2019ll finish the season with the top scoring defense in football, a running game that appears to finally be coming into form, and a QB who\u2019s accounted for nearly 5200 total yards and 42 total TDs. What does all that mean? Absolutely nothing. Now the *real* season starts, and the Bills will see the Patriots for the third time, Saturday night at 8:15. So BillsMafia, let\u2019s hear it one more time \u2014where else would you rather be than right here, right now?\n7.\t| [](/LAR) | Rams | \t-3\t|\t12-5\t|\tAt stake on Sunday was the #2 seed, Cooper Kupp breaking the receiving record, and at halftime, Sean McVay\u2019s win-when-leading-at-halftime streak. Unfortunately, the Rams again got bent by the 49ers and failed at all goals. This tail of two halves was a very frustrating finish to end the season/way to win the division/start the playoffs out. Rams fans have to like their initial matchup at home against ARI (thx Seattle), but the road to the Super Bowl is now unnecessarily harder, as a win in the first round most likely leads to a road game against GB in the second round.\n8.\t| [](/CIN) | Bengals | \t+1\t|\t10-7\t|\tThe Bengals are heading back to the playoffs for the first time since the 2015 season. The franchise's playoff struggles are well documented at this point, but only three players remain from the infamous 2015 debacle. This current roster, while playing for a team known for losing, knows nothing about losing themselves. They have a chance to change the narrative right now. \n9.\t| [](/NE) | Patriots | \t+1\t|\t10-7\t|\tThe Patriots are entering the playoffs exactly how you DON'T want to enter the playoffs. Slow starts, countless mistakes, and atypical penalties seem to indicate an early exit for this team. In context, Mac Jones had an incredible rookie season and the future is bright. However, the playoffs are a different animal and one of those animals is hosting the Patriots for round 3 after splitting the season series one game apiece. The forecast for Buffalo on Saturday night? Cold, light winds, and potential snow showers....insert eye emojis here.  \n10.\t| [](/ARI) | Cardinals | \t-2\t|\t11-6\t|\tAt the start of the season I wrote that this team needed to make the playoffs to keep Kliff\u2019s seat cold. And they did! In the worst, most Cardinals way imaginable. Limping on into the playoffs, about to face a boogeyman of a Rams team on *PRIMETIME* is the worst way you can get to the postseason. This football team loves to destroy expectations though, so hopefully they can do that a couple more times and actually win some football games.\n11.\t| [](/SF) | 49ers | \t+2\t|\t10-7\t|\tThe victory in Los Angeles perfectly showed the Jeckyll and Hyde act the team has done all season.  The first half, with just 84 yards of total offense and a 17-3 deficit, was the team who lost to the Seahawks twice, and the Colt McCoy led cardinals.  The second half and overtime, outscoring the Rams 24-7, looked like the team who had beaten the playoff bound Bengals and forced the 1 seed Packers to kick a last minute field goal to win.  The question is which team shows up in Dallas on Sunday?\n12.\t| [](/OAK) | Raiders | \t+3\t|\t10-7\t|\tThe first season I ever truly followed football the Raiders made the Super Bowl. It was an awful game but I figured next year we'd make another push and try again. The Raiders didn't make the playoffs again for another 14 years, and they went into that playoff game with a rookie QB who had never started a game before. I had to work that day and didn't even get to watch the game. This is the first Raiders playoff game I personally will have watched in 20 years. Win or lose, after everything this team has been through this year, this season has been a massive success and there is hope for the future. \n13.\t| [](/LAC) | Chargers | \t-1\t|\t9-8\t|\tIf you want to get a good feel for how the Chargers' 2021 season played out, just look at the last three games. You'll find embarrassing, unexplainable performances against teams like the Texans. You'll find complete efforts with total domination in all phases like when we beat up on Denver. And then you have games like Sunday night. Games where the Chargers will recover from self-inflicted wounds and opponents performing well against us and make magical comebacks attempts that ultimately fall short. The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same. Congratulations to the Raiders, they earned it. The Chargers showed everyone in the league once again that the blueprint is there for success, but building a winner takes more than a blueprint.\n14.\t| [](/PHI) | Eagles | \t--\t|\t9-8\t|\tThe Eagles enter the playoffs as one of the hottest teams in the NFL.  Whether they have the necessary depth and experience for a deep playoff push, time will tell.  A wild-card weekend draw against defending Super Bowl Champion Bucs isn't ideal, but the last time Tom Brady met the Eagles in the playoffs, it [didn't exactly go his way](https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400999173).\n15.\t| [](/PIT) | Steelers | \t+2\t|\t9-7-1\t|\tComing into Sunday, the Pittsburgh Steelers were arguably the biggest story in the NFL. In what seemed like the longest NFL Sunday for them, the stars aligned as they managed to eke out a victory against the Ravens while they waited for the biggest miracle: The hapless Jaguars knocking the Colts out of the playoffs so the Steelers could advance. While it was extremely unlikely, the Sparkle Kitties shone brightly and bucked the Colts. All the Steelers needed was for the most likely thing to happen, which was for the Chargers and Raiders to simply not tie. And yet those teams did their best to do just that. Inexplicably, in overtime, with the Steelers playoff dreams on the line, the Chargers called a timeout when the Raiders were content to concede the tie and have them both go on to the playoffs. Instead, the Raiders decided to put the Chargers away once and for all and give Big Ben one last unlikely chance to get revenge against the Chiefs for this season's humiliating defeat at their hands just three weeks ago.\n16.\t| [](/IND) | Colts | \t-5\t|\t9-8\t|\tWelp. In my preseason blurb about the Colts, I said it was up to Carson Wentz to determine if this team could reach bigger heights than last year's team. I guess we've got our answer, at least for now. What stings most about this loss, more than the failure to reach the postseason and even the wasting an MVP-esque season from Jonathan Taylor, is that we still know nothing about this team. Can Wentz be a franchise quarterback? Maybe. He was solid the first half of the season, including some star performances, but he fell apart in the second half and turned into a game-manager at best. Is the defense an elite unit? Maybe. They definitely had games where they dominated high-powered offenses, but also had games where they completely collapsed against weaker teams (like the Ravens and Jaguars). Is Frank Reich a good coach? Maybe. He called some masterful games against playoff teams like the 49ers, Bills, Patriots, and Cardinals, but was also too keen to step away from the running attack (as seen in both Titans games) and had several instances of bizarre playcalling (in particular the early 4th down decisions against the Rams). At their best, the Colts could replicate something of an elite team. They could hang with the absolute best in the league, and even beat them handily. But when it mattered most, they blew two win-and-in games and cost themselves the playoffs. Good luck to the Raiders and Steelers. You guys earned your postseason berths. May the Colts find some answers next year.\n17.\t| [](/MIA) | Dolphins | \t+1\t|\t9-8\t|\tThis should be about how the Dolphins swept the Patriots and how awesome that is, but instead it's about how this trash franchise wants to stay trash forever as they fire a good coach and start the transition process once again.  So congratulations, Brian Flores for sweeping the Patriots for the first time in over 2 decades, your reward will be coaching for a better franchise next year.  \n18.\t| [](/NO) | Saints | \t+1\t|\t9-8\t|\t\"In all honesty, this result feels about right for this season. We all know about the phenomenal number of starters the 2021 Saints had to use and it's hard to gain consistency with that sort of churn. These words from Sean Payton are fitting: \u201cYou keep getting different curveballs, and it gets back to that mantra where, \u2018Hey, no one really cares about your challenges.\u2019 In fact, there's a group of people that are glad you have \u2018em.\"\"\"\n19.\t| [](/BAL) | Ravens | \t-3\t|\t8-9\t|\tPutting the Steelers in the playoffs really stings. Hard fought loss into overtime, but unfortunately missed a lot of opportunities that would've changed the game in our favor. Tyler Huntley did an admirable job but he is not Lamar Jackson. This team is completely obliterated by injuries in a way that would not recover by playoffs, and there was no hope in hell even with Lamar Jackson and those receivers. A healthy version of this team would have an insane ceiling, and I hope this offseason is spent looking closely at health and conditioning. Also a thorough evaluation of playcalling and pass play design, because we have the receivers next year and it's all trending in the right direction; just sign a good #3 (be it another year of Watkins or what) because this offense has an insane ceiling once Dobbins, Edwards, and Stanley come back. The defense has been very un-clutch, but you can't help but wonder how much better things would be with Humphrey and Peters out there in the closing stretch. DL has been fantastic (especially at run defense) and Patrick Queen has been mostly good since moving to Will. Here's to health in 2022.\n20.\t| [](/CLE) | Browns | \t+1\t|\t8-9\t|\tThe Browns finished with a 8-9 record, five pro-bowlers, and third in the division. They will watch two division rivals in the playoffs. Baker will finally have surgery. Lackluster finish to the year but there is some stability going into 2022. They wont be looking for a new head coach and will very likely have most of the key players back. It's more about improving, for once, than a complete rebuild.\n21.\t| [](/MIN) | Vikings | \t-1\t|\t8-9\t|\t\n22.\t| [](/DEN) | Broncos | \t--\t|\t7-10\t|\tIt's over. It's done.\n23.\t| [](/SEA) | Seahawks | \t+1\t|\t7-10\t|\tIt feels so nice to take down a division rival, especially when that division rival has something to play for. In typical Seattle fashion, the Seahawks went to Arizona and unleashed the greatest running back of all time (Rashaad Penny) all over the poor Cardinals. Penny racked up 190 rushing yards on 23 carries, adding a touchdown. Russ did not have his best game, but he did throw 3 touchdowns, two of which were awesome plays to Tyler Lockett. With Bobby Wagner out, jordyn Brooks was all over the field making 20 tackles and Carlos Dunlap was in the backfield often, sacking Kyler twice. it was an awesome Seattle win. now, we buckle in for an interesting offseason.\n24.\t| [](/ATL) | Falcons | \t-1\t|\t7-10\t|\tA final chance to stop the Saints from a playoff berth and Atlanta stopped short. The offensive line was consistently pushed back, and the trenches of New Orleans had a field day. Luckily, Shanahan has an easier time coming back from a deficit than holding a lead, as a result Tampa Bay will be the only NFC South team in the 2021 playoffs. For Atlanta, the 8th overall pick is confirmed, giving plenty of draft capital for 2022 improvement. Having a roster mostly made of vet minimum journeymen makes one all the more thankful for the AJ Terrells and Younghoe Koos of the world. 7-10 is a solid stepping stone, but only time will tell. \n25.\t| [](/WAS) | Washington FT |\t+1\t|\t7-10\t|\t\" And the \"\"Washington Football Team\"\" era comes to an end with a feel good division win... that will more than likely push Washington out of draft position at #11 to grab a top QB prospect but what else is new? The Giants are as much of a mess as WFT right now but a win is a win. Hats off to Taylor Heinicke for coming in as a backup, giving this team a spark and keeping them in the hunt all the way up to week 17 but it's been made clear that a QB is Washington's top priority in the off-season. It's hard to gauge because the wins still haven't been there but you can argue that the arrow is slightly tilted upward with Ron Rivera if they can get the QB position settled.\"\n26.\t| [](/CHI) | Bears | \t-1\t|\t6-11\t|\tThe Bears got the *soft* reset their fans wanted. But the same inept ownership is leading essentially the same process that resulted in Emery/Trestman and Pace/Nagy, so any optimism about a nu start should be tempered. If the Bears luck into a GM/HC combo that works, great things could be in store with the quarterback position (mostly? hopefully?) handled. If they swing and miss again, don't worry -- McCaskey is accountable to his mommy.\n27.\t| [](/DET) | Lions | \t+3\t|\t3-13-1\t|\t\n28.\t| [](/CAR) | Panthers | \t-1\t|\t5-12\t|\t#SendRhuleBackToSchool\n29.\t| [](/HOU) | Texans | \t-1\t|\t4-13\t|\t\"The concept of a \"\"quality loss\"\" is something of a punchline these days, but this loss against the Titans was a quality loss. Mills looked like the truth out there against a good Titans squad. Losing means a higher draft pick, but it was a close game and the Texans showed a level of grit that was missing in the first half of the season. This season sucked, but we come to the end of it with a reason to hope. \"\n30.\t| [](/NYJ) | Jets | \t-2\t|\t4-13\t|\tThe Jets roster has plenty of holes as the regular season ends, but there's also a ton of assets with which to fill those holes. Joe Douglas enters the offseason with $60 million in cap space to go along with the 4th, 10th, 35th, 38th and 69th (nice) picks to inject some more young talent into an already very young team. It may not be obvious from the outside, but the rebuild has made significant progress. That said, next year needs to be a year where the Jets are in the hunt for a playoff spot, and Jets fans should accept nothing less.\n31.\t| [](/JAX) | Jaguars | \t+1\t|\t3-14\t|\t\"The Jaguars have done the most delicious thing imaginable for a 3-14 team: They knock off their division rival in the last game of the season, helping ensure they don't make the playoffs. What's more, they managed to do that and *retain* the first overall draft pick. While it would be kind to describe the season as a whole for Jacksonville as \"\"shittastic\"\", concluding it as such feels like the smallest nibble of karmic balance.\"\n32.\t| [](/NYG) | Giants | \t-1\t|\t4-13\t|\tFor Giants fans, the suffering finally ends as a painful 2022 season comes to a close. Amid injuries, miscues, firings and overall incompetence, there's no doubts in the building that change has to happen. The exact level of change, however, remains to be seen. NY and its fans now looks to the team's future, specifically the 2022 NFL Draft, where the Giants have 2 top-10 picks and 5 in the first 3 rounds. Once again, the rebuild is on for Big Blue. Will they get it right this time?",

Discuss! &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTRFy5Vb0-4MubRy5rOfEyUU64GZ48oRedmD9MDIZhX8ZPWV4FBM9wJ-qYFWbLud22pLSchLGcks4d8/pubhtml?gid=369154607&amp;amp;single=true\"&gt;30/32 reporting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"right\"&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Team&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;\u0394&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Record&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Comment&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;1.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/GB\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Packers&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;13-4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Manningcast curse strikes again I suppose!

Regardless, thanks to the Jags the Chiefs will play the Steelers in round one of the playoffs which is the best matchup they could hope for. It is time for the Chiefs to lean on their playoff experience and try to make the Super Bowl for the third straight year, this time as a wild card team.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;4.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/TEN\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Titans&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;12-5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Titans took care of business against the Texans on Sunday and wrapped up the #1 seed in the AFC and a bye week before the Divisional round.  &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeMiracles/status/1480584656395415571\"&gt;The Titans became the 1st team in NFL history to record at least 8 wins against teams with a winning record at the end of the year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;5.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/DAL\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Cowboys&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;12-5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;This was treated like the last night of the season for a High School team.

Dak is the new franchise TD holder, the team set the league record for most individual players to find the end zone, Zeke&amp;#39;s cousin got to score, and drafting Ito Smith in a dynasty league finally paid off. Most importantly, the team is rolling hot into the playoffs.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;6.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/BUF\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Bills&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;11-6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Bills once again had to contend with bad weather at home, with some wild winds slowing down the passing attack, shortening punts, and making field goals nearly impossible for the team driving into it. Despite that, the Bills out-gained the Jets by an astonishing 371 yards in the 27-10 win, and in turn, secured the AFC East for the second year in a row. This marks the first time they\u2019ve done that since a run of four straight between \u201888 and \u201891, and the first time they were able to secure it at home since 1995. They\u2019ll finish the season with the top scoring defense in football, a running game that appears to finally be coming into form, and a QB who\u2019s accounted for nearly 5200 total yards and 42 total TDs. What does all that mean? Absolutely nothing. Now the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; season starts, and the Bills will see the Patriots for the third time, Saturday night at 8:15. So BillsMafia, let\u2019s hear it one more time \u2014where else would you rather be than right here, right now?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;7.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/LAR\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Rams&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;12-5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;At stake on Sunday was the #2 seed, Cooper Kupp breaking the receiving record, and at halftime, Sean McVay\u2019s win-when-leading-at-halftime streak. Unfortunately, the Rams again got bent by the 49ers and failed at all goals. This tail of two halves was a very frustrating finish to end the season/way to win the division/start the playoffs out. Rams fans have to like their initial matchup at home against ARI (thx Seattle), but the road to the Super Bowl is now unnecessarily harder, as a win in the first round most likely leads to a road game against GB in the second round.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;8.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/CIN\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Bengals&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;10-7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Bengals are heading back to the playoffs for the first time since the 2015 season. The franchise&amp;#39;s playoff struggles are well documented at this point, but only three players remain from the infamous 2015 debacle. This current roster, while playing for a team known for losing, knows nothing about losing themselves. They have a chance to change the narrative right now.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;9.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/NE\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Patriots&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;10-7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Patriots are entering the playoffs exactly how you DON&amp;#39;T want to enter the playoffs. Slow starts, countless mistakes, and atypical penalties seem to indicate an early exit for this team. In context, Mac Jones had an incredible rookie season and the future is bright. However, the playoffs are a different animal and one of those animals is hosting the Patriots for round 3 after splitting the season series one game apiece. The forecast for Buffalo on Saturday night? Cold, light winds, and potential snow showers....insert eye emojis here.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;10.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ARI\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Cardinals&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;11-6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;At the start of the season I wrote that this team needed to make the playoffs to keep Kliff\u2019s seat cold. And they did! In the worst, most Cardinals way imaginable. Limping on into the playoffs, about to face a boogeyman of a Rams team on &lt;em&gt;PRIMETIME&lt;/em&gt; is the worst way you can get to the postseason. This football team loves to destroy expectations though, so hopefully they can do that a couple more times and actually win some football games.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;11.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/SF\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;49ers&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;10-7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The victory in Los Angeles perfectly showed the Jeckyll and Hyde act the team has done all season.  The first half, with just 84 yards of total offense and a 17-3 deficit, was the team who lost to the Seahawks twice, and the Colt McCoy led cardinals.  The second half and overtime, outscoring the Rams 24-7, looked like the team who had beaten the playoff bound Bengals and forced the 1 seed Packers to kick a last minute field goal to win.  The question is which team shows up in Dallas on Sunday?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;12.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/OAK\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Raiders&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;10-7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The first season I ever truly followed football the Raiders made the Super Bowl. It was an awful game but I figured next year we&amp;#39;d make another push and try again. The Raiders didn&amp;#39;t make the playoffs again for another 14 years, and they went into that playoff game with a rookie QB who had never started a game before. I had to work that day and didn&amp;#39;t even get to watch the game. This is the first Raiders playoff game I personally will have watched in 20 years. Win or lose, after everything this team has been through this year, this season has been a massive success and there is hope for the future.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;13.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/LAC\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Chargers&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;9-8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;If you want to get a good feel for how the Chargers&amp;#39; 2021 season played out, just look at the last three games. You&amp;#39;ll find embarrassing, unexplainable performances against teams like the Texans. You&amp;#39;ll find complete efforts with total domination in all phases like when we beat up on Denver. And then you have games like Sunday night. Games where the Chargers will recover from self-inflicted wounds and opponents performing well against us and make magical comebacks attempts that ultimately fall short. The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same. Congratulations to the Raiders, they earned it. The Chargers showed everyone in the league once again that the blueprint is there for success, but building a winner takes more than a blueprint.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;14.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/PHI\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Eagles&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;9-8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Eagles enter the playoffs as one of the hottest teams in the NFL.  Whether they have the necessary depth and experience for a deep playoff push, time will tell.  A wild-card weekend draw against defending Super Bowl Champion Bucs isn&amp;#39;t ideal, but the last time Tom Brady met the Eagles in the playoffs, it &lt;a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/400999173\"&gt;didn&amp;#39;t exactly go his way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;15.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/PIT\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Steelers&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;9-7-1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Coming into Sunday, the Pittsburgh Steelers were arguably the biggest story in the NFL. In what seemed like the longest NFL Sunday for them, the stars aligned as they managed to eke out a victory against the Ravens while they waited for the biggest miracle: The hapless Jaguars knocking the Colts out of the playoffs so the Steelers could advance. While it was extremely unlikely, the Sparkle Kitties shone brightly and bucked the Colts. All the Steelers needed was for the most likely thing to happen, which was for the Chargers and Raiders to simply not tie. And yet those teams did their best to do just that. Inexplicably, in overtime, with the Steelers playoff dreams on the line, the Chargers called a timeout when the Raiders were content to concede the tie and have them both go on to the playoffs. Instead, the Raiders decided to put the Chargers away once and for all and give Big Ben one last unlikely chance to get revenge against the Chiefs for this season&amp;#39;s humiliating defeat at their hands just three weeks ago.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;16.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/IND\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Colts&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;9-8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Welp. In my preseason blurb about the Colts, I said it was up to Carson Wentz to determine if this team could reach bigger heights than last year&amp;#39;s team. I guess we&amp;#39;ve got our answer, at least for now. What stings most about this loss, more than the failure to reach the postseason and even the wasting an MVP-esque season from Jonathan Taylor, is that we still know nothing about this team. Can Wentz be a franchise quarterback? Maybe. He was solid the first half of the season, including some star performances, but he fell apart in the second half and turned into a game-manager at best. Is the defense an elite unit? Maybe. They definitely had games where they dominated high-powered offenses, but also had games where they completely collapsed against weaker teams (like the Ravens and Jaguars). Is Frank Reich a good coach? Maybe. He called some masterful games against playoff teams like the 49ers, Bills, Patriots, and Cardinals, but was also too keen to step away from the running attack (as seen in both Titans games) and had several instances of bizarre playcalling (in particular the early 4th down decisions against the Rams). At their best, the Colts could replicate something of an elite team. They could hang with the absolute best in the league, and even beat them handily. But when it mattered most, they blew two win-and-in games and cost themselves the playoffs. Good luck to the Raiders and Steelers. You guys earned your postseason berths. May the Colts find some answers next year.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;17.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/MIA\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Dolphins&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;9-8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;This should be about how the Dolphins swept the Patriots and how awesome that is, but instead it&amp;#39;s about how this trash franchise wants to stay trash forever as they fire a good coach and start the transition process once again.  So congratulations, Brian Flores for sweeping the Patriots for the first time in over 2 decades, your reward will be coaching for a better franchise next year.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;18.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/NO\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Saints&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;9-8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;quot;In all honesty, this result feels about right for this season. We all know about the phenomenal number of starters the 2021 Saints had to use and it&amp;#39;s hard to gain consistency with that sort of churn. These words from Sean Payton are fitting: \u201cYou keep getting different curveballs, and it gets back to that mantra where, \u2018Hey, no one really cares about your challenges.\u2019 In fact, there&amp;#39;s a group of people that are glad you have \u2018em.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;19.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/BAL\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Ravens&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;8-9&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Putting the Steelers in the playoffs really stings. Hard fought loss into overtime, but unfortunately missed a lot of opportunities that would&amp;#39;ve changed the game in our favor. Tyler Huntley did an admirable job but he is not Lamar Jackson. This team is completely obliterated by injuries in a way that would not recover by playoffs, and there was no hope in hell even with Lamar Jackson and those receivers. A healthy version of this team would have an insane ceiling, and I hope this offseason is spent looking closely at health and conditioning. Also a thorough evaluation of playcalling and pass play design, because we have the receivers next year and it&amp;#39;s all trending in the right direction; just sign a good #3 (be it another year of Watkins or what) because this offense has an insane ceiling once Dobbins, Edwards, and Stanley come back. The defense has been very un-clutch, but you can&amp;#39;t help but wonder how much better things would be with Humphrey and Peters out there in the closing stretch. DL has been fantastic (especially at run defense) and Patrick Queen has been mostly good since moving to Will. Here&amp;#39;s to health in 2022.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;20.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/CLE\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Browns&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;8-9&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Browns finished with a 8-9 record, five pro-bowlers, and third in the division. They will watch two division rivals in the playoffs. Baker will finally have surgery. Lackluster finish to the year but there is some stability going into 2022. They wont be looking for a new head coach and will very likely have most of the key players back. It&amp;#39;s more about improving, for once, than a complete rebuild.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;21.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/MIN\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Vikings&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;8-9&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;22.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/DEN\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Broncos&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;7-10&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s over.

In typical Seattle fashion, the Seahawks went to Arizona and unleashed the greatest running back of all time (Rashaad Penny) all over the poor Cardinals. Penny racked up 190 rushing yards on 23 carries, adding a touchdown. Russ did not have his best game, but he did throw 3 touchdowns, two of which were awesome plays to Tyler Lockett. With Bobby Wagner out, jordyn Brooks was all over the field making 20 tackles and Carlos Dunlap was in the backfield often, sacking Kyler twice. it was an awesome Seattle win. now, we buckle in for an interesting offseason.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;24.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ATL\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Falcons&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;7-10&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;A final chance to stop the Saints from a playoff berth and Atlanta stopped short. The offensive line was consistently pushed back, and the trenches of New Orleans had a field day. Luckily, Shanahan has an easier time coming back from a deficit than holding a lead, as a result Tampa Bay will be the only NFC South team in the 2021 playoffs. For Atlanta, the 8th overall pick is confirmed, giving plenty of draft capital for 2022 improvement. Having a roster mostly made of vet minimum journeymen makes one all the more thankful for the AJ Terrells and Younghoe Koos of the world. 7-10 is a solid stepping stone, but only time will tell.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;25.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/WAS\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Washington FT&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;7-10&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;quot; And the &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Washington Football Team&amp;quot;&amp;quot; era comes to an end with a feel good division win... that will more than likely push Washington out of draft position at #11 to grab a top QB prospect but what else is new? The Giants are as much of a mess as WFT right now but a win is a win. Hats off to Taylor Heinicke for coming in as a backup, giving this team a spark and keeping them in the hunt all the way up to week 17 but it&amp;#39;s been made clear that a QB is Washington&amp;#39;s top priority in the off-season. It&amp;#39;s hard to gauge because the wins still haven&amp;#39;t been there but you can argue that the arrow is slightly tilted upward with Ron Rivera if they can get the QB position settled.&amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;26.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/CHI\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Bears&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;6-11&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Bears got the &lt;em&gt;soft&lt;/em&gt; reset their fans wanted. But the same inept ownership is leading essentially the same process that resulted in Emery/Trestman and Pace/Nagy, so any optimism about a nu start should be tempered. If the Bears luck into a GM/HC combo that works, great things could be in store with the quarterback position (mostly? hopefully?) handled. If they swing and miss again, don&amp;#39;t worry -- McCaskey is accountable to his mommy.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;27.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/DET\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Lions&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;3-13-1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;28.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/CAR\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Panthers&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5-12&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;#SendRhuleBackToSchool&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;29.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/HOU\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Texans&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;4-13&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;quot;The concept of a &amp;quot;&amp;quot;quality loss&amp;quot;&amp;quot; is something of a punchline these days, but this loss against the Titans was a quality loss. Mills looked like the truth out there against a good Titans squad. Losing means a higher draft pick, but it was a close game and the Texans showed a level of grit that was missing in the first half of the season. This season sucked, but we come to the end of it with a reason to hope. &amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;30.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/NYJ\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Jets&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;4-13&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Jets roster has plenty of holes as the regular season ends, but there&amp;#39;s also a ton of assets with which to fill those holes. Joe Douglas enters the offseason with $60 million in cap space to go along with the 4th, 10th, 35th, 38th and 69th (nice) picks to inject some more young talent into an already very young team. It may not be obvious from the outside, but the rebuild has made significant progress. That said, next year needs to be a year where the Jets are in the hunt for a playoff spot, and Jets fans should accept nothing less.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;31.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/JAX\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Jaguars&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;+1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;3-14&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;quot;The Jaguars have done the most delicious thing imaginable for a 3-14 team: They knock off their division rival in the last game of the season, helping ensure they don&amp;#39;t make the playoffs. What&amp;#39;s more, they managed to do that and &lt;em&gt;retain&lt;/em&gt; the first overall draft pick. While it would be kind to describe the season as a whole for Jacksonville as &amp;quot;&amp;quot;shittastic&amp;quot;&amp;quot;, concluding it as such feels like the smallest nibble of karmic balance.&amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;32.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/NYG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Giants&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;4-13&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;For Giants fans, the suffering finally ends as a painful 2022 season comes to a close. Amid injuries, miscues, firings and overall incompetence, there&amp;#39;s no doubts in the building that change has to happen. The exact level of change, however, remains to be seen. NY and its fans now looks to the team&amp;#39;s future, specifically the 2022 NFL Draft, where the Giants have 2 top-10 picks and 5 in the first 3 rounds. Once again, the rebuild is on for Big Blue. Will they get it right this time?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

In the cover, Judge is looking at the horizon in the walls of his castle. Ichiji and Reiju are sitting in the wall with him.*\n\n*Chapter starts in the \u201cFlower Capital\u201d. We see that people are still enjoying the festival, although it's already ending. Some children and adults are writing wishes on floating paper lanterns to send them to their ancestors and fulfill the wishes.*\n\n*Cut to the roof of Onigashima's castle. The fight between Luffy and Kaidou has stopped. Luffy looks surprised at Kaidou (who is back to human form) because Kaidou has gotten a barrel of sake and is calmly drinking it. Luffy yells at him angrily.*\n\n*Luffy: \"Why are you drinking!!\"*\n\n*Kaidou: \"I'm drinking because I'm having fun...!!Do you want some too? Today...Is the \u201cFire Festival\u201d in the capital!!We also held a \u201cgreat banquet\u201d at Onigashima!!Although you have ruined it!!!Fufufu...\"*\n\n*Suddenly, Kaidou starts crying with laughter.*\n\n*Kaidou: \"Haaahaahaha!! Hohoho!!Wi\\~\\~\\~!!!\"*\n\n*Luffy: \"You're drunk!!!\"*\n\n*Luffy takes off his cloak and runs towards Kaidou.*\n\n*Luffy: \"If you lose!!!You won't use that you were \u201cdrunk\u201d as excuse, right!?\"*\n\n*Kaidou keeps laughing, he's leaning on his kanabo to keep from falling.*\n\n*Kaidou: \"Fuhihi... You fucking idiot!!Wohohohohohoho!!Getting drunk doesn't make me weaker...I recognize you are STRONG!!Hic.Wohahahahahahahaha!!!\"*\n\n*Luffy blows up his right arm and stretches it out to attack Kaidou as he continues speaking.*\n\n*Kaidou: \"It's been a whilesince I fight anyone 1 Vs. 1 this seriously!!Wi\\~\\~\\~!!!\"*\n\n*Luffy attacks Kaidou, but Kaidou jumps back as he laughs and dodges the attack with a new technique.*\n\n*Kaidou: \"Oops \u266a\u201cShuron Hakke\u201d (Sake Dragon Bagua - \u9152\u9f8d\u516b\u5366 (\u3057\u3085\u308d\u3093 \u306f\u3063\u3051))!!!\"*\n\n*Kaidou changes to his hybrid form and uses a new battle style.*\n\n*Kaidou: \"\u201cWarai Jogo\u201d (Laughing Drunk Mode - \u8f2a\u96f7\u4e0a\u6238 (\u308f\u3089\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054))!!!\"*\n\n*Then Kaidou hits Luffy with his kanabo.*\n\n*Kaidou: \"Woororo!!\u201cRagnaraku!!!\u201d (Ragnaraku - \u5f15\u5948\u843d (\u30e9\u30b0\u306a\u3089\u304f))!!!\"*\n\n*Kaidou's attack has been so strong that people on the Live Floor see how part of the roof collapses. Luffy suffers the blow, Kaidou hit him on the forehead.*\n\n*Luffy: \"Woahhhh\\~\\~\\~!!\"*\n\n*Kaidou changes to his dragon form. He's on the ground, reeling from drunkenness.*\n\n*Kaidou: \"This is fun, but...!!Both the castle and the island are half destroyed...!!I'm useless\\~\\~\\~I can't protect even a single castle...\"*\n\n*Luffy: \"That hurts \\~\\~\\~!!!Dammit!!!\"*\n\n*Kaidou is devastated and sad, a text box tells us that he's into his \u201cSad Drunk Mode\u201d (Ochikomi Jogo - \u843d\u8fbc\u4e0a\u6238 (\u304a\u3061\u3053\u307f \u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054)).*\n\n*Kaidou: \"Just rebuild it...!!It will took around 5 years...!?Wi\\~\\~\\~\"*\n\n*Luffy gets up and runs towards Kaidou.*\n\n*Luffy: \"I must be careful!!Hah, hah...\"*\n\n*Kaidou: \"I've done my best\\~\\~\\~...Hic.Wi\\~\\~\\~ But...Maybe it was not enough\\~\\~\\~...\"*\n\n*When Luffy is about to reach Kaidou, he attacks Luffy.*\n\n*Kaidou: \"\u201cTatsu Maki Kaifuu\u201d (Dragon Twister Demolition Breath)!!!\"*\n\n*Luffy: \"Uohh!!!\"*\n\n*Luffy manages to deflect one of Kaidou's cutting blades, which cuts a rock in half easily. Kaidou changes to hybrid form and starts crying uncontrollably. Another text box tells us that Kaidou is now into his \u201cCrying Drunk Mode\u201d (Naki Jogo - \u6ce3\u304d\u4e0a\u6238 (\u306a\u304d \u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054)).*\n\n*Kaidou: \"Stay away from me...!!Shut up, stupid brat!!\"*\n\n*Kaidou prepares to attack Luffy again with his kanabo.*\n\n*Kaidou: \"Uonhhh!! ...Hic!!A persistent one like you should take this!!\u201cRaimei\u201d!!\"*\n\n*Luffy: \"Hah... Hah...I won't let you do it...\"*\n\n*Kaidou: \"\u201cHa\u201d...!!\"*\n\n*Kaidou tries to attack Luffy with \u201cRaimei Hakke\u201d, but just before he can do it, Luffy jumps up and dodges the attack. Luffy leans upon the kanabo to propel himself towards Kaidou, and in an impressive double page, he hits Kaidou's chin with a powerful kick with his left leg that he stretched just before. The attack is very powerful, with black lightings.*\n\n*But Kaidou doesn't give up, and manages to catch Luffy's right leg with his tail. Kaidou (who is still crying) drags Luffy towards him with his tail and they both collide with a huge headbutt. The impact is gigantic and a lot of black lightings come out of it. But Luffy and Kaidou heads do not touch.*\n\n*However, Kaidou prevailes over Luffy (that flies away).*\n\n*Luffy: \"Uahh!!His Haki is more powerful...!! \"*\n\n*After the crash, it seems that Kaidou drunkenness is getting over.*\n\n*Kaidou: \"... Ouhh!!... Damn, I feel stange...!!Wi\\~\\~\\~\"*\n\n*Suddenly, Kaidou gets angry and becomes very aggressive. Then he attacks Luffy with \u201cBolo Breath\u201d. A new text box tells us that Kaidou is now into his \u201cAnger Drunk Mode\u201d (Okori Jogo - \u6012\u308a\u4e0a\u6238 (\u304a\u3053\u308a \u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054)).*\n\n*Kaidou: \"I'm getting sober!!!\"*\n\n*Luffy dodges \u201cBolo Breath\u201d and goes again after Kaidou.*\n\n*Luffy: \"Hah, hah.\u201cGomu Gomu no\u201d...\u201cRoc\u201d...!!!\"*\n\n*Just before hitting him, Luffy sees that Kaidou starts spinning his kanabo in circles. In another masterful double page, Luffy and Kaidou attack at the same time.*\n\n*Luffy: \"\u201cGatling\u201d (Gum-Gum Roc Gatling - \u30b4\u30e0\u30b4\u30e0\u306e\u602a\u9ce5\u9283\u4e71\u6253 (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af \u30ac\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0))!!!!\"*\n\n*Kaidou: \"\u201cGundari\\*: Ryuseigun\u201d (Gundari: Dragon Army - \u8ecd\u837c\u5229 \u9f8d\u76db\u8ecd (\u3050\u3093\u3060\u308a \u308a\u3085\u3046\u305b\u3044\u3050\u3093))!!!\"*\n\n*\\*Translation note:* [*\u201cGundari\u201d*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Dali) *is one of the 5 Wisdom King (My\u014d\u014d) in Buddhism.*\n\n*Luffy attacks Kaidou with a lot of giant punches with \u201cColor of the Supreme King Haki\u201d. Kaidou counterattacks by swinging his kanabo and parrying the punches. Although both attacks are tight, sometimes both Luffy and Kaidou manage to hit each other.*\n\n*Luffy: \"Uoooooooh!!!\"*\n\n*Kaidou: \"Aaaaa\\~\\~\\~!!!\"*\n\n*Luffy slows down his attack and stops Kaidou's kanabo with his left hand. Then he stretches his left leg, blows up his foot, and hits Kaidou's stomach with a powerful kick.*\n\n*Kaidou: \"Ohhhhh!!!\"*\n\n*Kaidou's eyes go blank and blood comes out of his mouth. Luffy looks at him very serious and angry. The battle is red hot but...*\n\n*Cut to the top of the Red Line, to the \u201cHoly Land Mary Geoise\u201d. \u201cGorousei\u201d is gathered in the \u201cPangaea Castle\u201d.*\n\n*Gorousei 1: \"This year's \u201cReverie\u201d must be... cursed.\"*\n\n*Gorousei 2: \"Let's set that aside.Now we must focus on \u201cWanokuni\u201d.Who would have imagined this battle could go so far.\"*\n\n*Gorousei 3: \"It's time to do something... Nico Robin should have been arrested by now.With Kaidou and Big Mom fightingit won't be unnatural for someone to die during that battle...!! That person should be erased.\"*\n\n*Cut to the sea near of Wanokuni. World Government fleet is still there. One of the government agents reports the situation by Den Den Mushi.*\n\n*Government agent 1: \"All ships are still waiting for orders...Ahh...What's going on?\"*\n\n*Agent observes something with the binoculars from one of the ships, he's in shock...*\n\n*Government agent 1: \"Is approaching... A gigantic shadow is approaching...\"*\n\n*Government agent 2: \"What did you say?\"*\n\n*Government agent 1: \"I don't know what it is.An island?\"*\n\n*Back to \u201cPangaea Castle\u201d in \u201cMary Geoise\u201d.*\n\n*Gorousei with a birthmark spots on his forehead: \"No... That's impossible!!Even to us, that \u201cfruit\u201d has become a legend.For the past centuries, it hasn't even \u201cawakened\u201d once.*\n\n*Gorousei with blond hair and a short beard: \"Then why did the \u201cWorld Government\u201d...go out of their way to give THAT devil fruit another name!!\"*\n\n*In the last panel of the chapter, we discovered what Government agent was seeing. The gigantic shadow is Zunesha, the giant elephant that carries the island of Zou on his back. Zunesha is right behind the World Government fleet in the sea near of Wanokuni...*\n\n*Gorousei: \"The reason is they wanted to erase the original name of that fruit from history?!\"*\n\n*Editor's note: \"What's the true meaning of their words?\"*\n\n[Gorosei](https://preview.redd.it/pze4knkjp6a81.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d962ade9d2a517017af29f80cd6108fc60a4dc0)\n\nAdditional note from Redon -\n\nBefore you start criticizing the chapter, this time I really recommend you to wait for the images/scans. The fight between Luffy and Kaidou is visually amazing, the chapter gains a lot with images.\n\nRegarding the devil fruit  that the Gorousei talk about, as you have seen in the summary, this chapter does not say which one it is.\n\nAs a reference, I can tell you that the final sentence of the Gorousei (\"The reason is that they wanted to eliminate the original name of that fruit from history!?\") appears in the final vignette of the chapter, in which we see Zunesha just behind the fleet of ships of the World Government (the one I was talking about the other day). Although it's not clear to me if Oda wants to tell us whether the devil fruit is linked to Zunesha or not.\n\nMy opinion\u00a0is that I think the Gorousei is talking about the devil fruit of one of the users Wano right now, but I couldn't tell if they are talking about the Gomu Gomu no Mi or a different fruit. I also think the Gorousei don't have much idea on what the World Government did in the past on this topic (the Government or a Gorousei from previous generations).\n\n**BREAK NEXT WEEK**\n\nRaws for this chapter this Thursday\n\nEnglish scans for this chapter this Friday\n\nScans for 1038 will release on 28th Jan.",

Hohoho!!Wi~~~!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy: &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re drunk!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy takes off his cloak and runs towards Kaidou.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy: &amp;quot;If you lose!!!You won&amp;#39;t use that you were \u201cdrunk\u201d as excuse, right!?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou keeps laughing, he&amp;#39;s leaning on his kanabo to keep from falling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;Fuhihi... You fucking idiot!!Wohohohohohoho!!Getting drunk doesn&amp;#39;t make me weaker...I recognize you are STRONG!!Hic.Wohahahahahahahaha!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy blows up his right arm and stretches it out to attack Kaidou as he continues speaking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been a whilesince I fight anyone 1 Vs. 1 this seriously!!Wi~~~!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy attacks Kaidou, but Kaidou jumps back as he laughs and dodges the attack with a new technique.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;Oops \u266a\u201cShuron Hakke\u201d (Sake Dragon Bagua - \u9152\u9f8d\u516b\u5366 (\u3057\u3085\u308d\u3093 \u306f\u3063\u3051))!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou changes to his hybrid form and uses a new battle style.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;\u201cWarai Jogo\u201d (Laughing Drunk Mode - \u8f2a\u96f7\u4e0a\u6238 (\u308f\u3089\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054))!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then Kaidou hits Luffy with his kanabo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;Woororo!!\u201cRagnaraku!!!\u201d (Ragnaraku - \u5f15\u5948\u843d (\u30e9\u30b0\u306a\u3089\u304f))!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou&amp;#39;s attack has been so strong that people on the Live Floor see how part of the roof collapses. Luffy suffers the blow, Kaidou hit him on the forehead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy: &amp;quot;Woahhhh~~~!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou changes to his dragon form. He&amp;#39;s on the ground, reeling from drunkenness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;This is fun, but...!!Both the castle and the island are half destroyed...!!I&amp;#39;m useless~~~I can&amp;#39;t protect even a single castle...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy: &amp;quot;That hurts ~~~!!!Dammit!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou is devastated and sad, a text box tells us that he&amp;#39;s into his \u201cSad Drunk Mode\u201d (Ochikomi Jogo - \u843d\u8fbc\u4e0a\u6238 (\u304a\u3061\u3053\u307f \u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054)).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;Just rebuild it...!!It will took around 5 years...!?Wi~~~&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy gets up and runs towards Kaidou.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy: &amp;quot;I must be careful!!Hah, hah...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve done my best~~~...Hic.Wi~~~ But...Maybe it was not enough~~~...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Luffy is about to reach Kaidou, he attacks Luffy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;\u201cTatsu Maki Kaifuu\u201d (Dragon Twister Demolition Breath)!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy: &amp;quot;Uohh!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy manages to deflect one of Kaidou&amp;#39;s cutting blades, which cuts a rock in half easily. Kaidou changes to hybrid form and starts crying uncontrollably. Another text box tells us that Kaidou is now into his \u201cCrying Drunk Mode\u201d (Naki Jogo - \u6ce3\u304d\u4e0a\u6238 (\u306a\u304d \u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054)).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;Stay away from me...!!Shut up, stupid brat!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou prepares to attack Luffy again with his kanabo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;Uonhhh!! ...Hic!!A persistent one like you should take this!!\u201cRaimei\u201d!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy: &amp;quot;Hah... Hah...I won&amp;#39;t let you do it...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;\u201cHa\u201d...!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou tries to attack Luffy with \u201cRaimei Hakke\u201d, but just before he can do it, Luffy jumps up and dodges the attack. Luffy leans upon the kanabo to propel himself towards Kaidou, and in an impressive double page, he hits Kaidou&amp;#39;s chin with a powerful kick with his left leg that he stretched just before. The attack is very powerful, with black lightings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But Kaidou doesn&amp;#39;t give up, and manages to catch Luffy&amp;#39;s right leg with his tail. Kaidou (who is still crying) drags Luffy towards him with his tail and they both collide with a huge headbutt. The impact is gigantic and a lot of black lightings come out of it. But Luffy and Kaidou heads do not touch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, Kaidou prevailes over Luffy (that flies away).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy: &amp;quot;Uahh!!His Haki is more powerful...!! &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After the crash, it seems that Kaidou drunkenness is getting over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;... Ouhh!!... Damn, I feel stange...!!Wi~~~&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suddenly, Kaidou gets angry and becomes very aggressive. Then he attacks Luffy with \u201cBolo Breath\u201d. A new text box tells us that Kaidou is now into his \u201cAnger Drunk Mode\u201d (Okori Jogo - \u6012\u308a\u4e0a\u6238 (\u304a\u3053\u308a \u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054)).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m getting sober!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy dodges \u201cBolo Breath\u201d and goes again after Kaidou.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy: &amp;quot;Hah, hah.\u201cGomu Gomu no\u201d...\u201cRoc\u201d...!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just before hitting him, Luffy sees that Kaidou starts spinning his kanabo in circles. In another masterful double page, Luffy and Kaidou attack at the same time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy: &amp;quot;\u201cGatling\u201d (Gum-Gum Roc Gatling - \u30b4\u30e0\u30b4\u30e0\u306e\u602a\u9ce5\u9283\u4e71\u6253 (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af \u30ac\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0))!!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;\u201cGundari\\&lt;/em&gt;: Ryuseigun\u201d (Gundari: Dragon Army - \u8ecd\u837c\u5229 \u9f8d\u76db\u8ecd (\u3050\u3093\u3060\u308a \u308a\u3085\u3046\u305b\u3044\u3050\u3093))!!!&amp;quot;*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\\&lt;/em&gt;Translation note:* &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Dali\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cGundari\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;is one of the 5 Wisdom King (My\u014d\u014d) in Buddhism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy attacks Kaidou with a lot of giant punches with \u201cColor of the Supreme King Haki\u201d. Kaidou counterattacks by swinging his kanabo and parrying the punches. Although both attacks are tight, sometimes both Luffy and Kaidou manage to hit each other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy: &amp;quot;Uoooooooh!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;Aaaaa~~~!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luffy slows down his attack and stops Kaidou&amp;#39;s kanabo with his left hand. Then he stretches his left leg, blows up his foot, and hits Kaidou&amp;#39;s stomach with a powerful kick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou: &amp;quot;Ohhhhh!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaidou&amp;#39;s eyes go blank and blood comes out of his mouth. Luffy looks at him very serious and angry. The battle is red hot but...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cut to the top of the Red Line, to the \u201cHoly Land Mary Geoise\u201d. \u201cGorousei\u201d is gathered in the \u201cPangaea Castle\u201d.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorousei 1: &amp;quot;This year&amp;#39;s \u201cReverie\u201d must be... cursed.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorousei 2: &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s set that aside.Now we must focus on \u201cWanokuni\u201d.Who would have imagined this battle could go so far.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorousei 3: &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s time to do something... Nico Robin should have been arrested by now.With Kaidou and Big Mom fightingit won&amp;#39;t be unnatural for someone to die during that battle...!! That person should be erased.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cut to the sea near of Wanokuni. World Government fleet is still there. One of the government agents reports the situation by Den Den Mushi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Government agent 1: &amp;quot;All ships are still waiting for orders...Ahh...What&amp;#39;s going on?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agent observes something with the binoculars from one of the ships, he&amp;#39;s in shock...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Government agent 1: &amp;quot;Is approaching... A gigantic shadow is approaching...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Government agent 2: &amp;quot;What did you say?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Government agent 1: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what it is.An island?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back to \u201cPangaea Castle\u201d in \u201cMary Geoise\u201d.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorousei with a birthmark spots on his forehead: &amp;quot;No... That&amp;#39;s impossible!!Even to us, that \u201cfruit\u201d has become a legend.For the past centuries, it hasn&amp;#39;t even \u201cawakened\u201d once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorousei with blond hair and a short beard: &amp;quot;Then why did the \u201cWorld Government\u201d...go out of their way to give THAT devil fruit another name!!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the last panel of the chapter, we discovered what Government agent was seeing. The gigantic shadow is Zunesha, the giant elephant that carries the island of Zou on his back. Zunesha is right behind the World Government fleet in the sea near of Wanokuni...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorousei: &amp;quot;The reason is they wanted to erase the original name of that fruit from history?!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;#39;s note: &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the true meaning of their words?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pze4knkjp6a81.png?width=829&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3d962ade9d2a517017af29f80cd6108fc60a4dc0\"&gt;Gorosei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additional note from Redon -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you start criticizing the chapter, this time I really recommend you to wait for the images/scans. The fight between Luffy and Kaidou is visually amazing, the chapter gains a lot with images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding the devil fruit  that the Gorousei talk about, as you have seen in the summary, this chapter does not say which one it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a reference, I can tell you that the final sentence of the Gorousei (&amp;quot;The reason is that they wanted to eliminate the original name of that fruit from history!?&amp;quot;) appears in the final vignette of the chapter, in which we see Zunesha just behind the fleet of ships of the World Government (the one I was talking about the other day). Although it&amp;#39;s not clear to me if Oda wants to tell us whether the devil fruit is linked to Zunesha or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My opinion\u00a0is that I think the Gorousei is talking about the devil fruit of one of the users Wano right now, but I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if they are talking about the Gomu Gomu no Mi or a different fruit. I also think the Gorousei don&amp;#39;t have much idea on what the World Government did in the past on this topic (the Government or a Gorousei from previous generations).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAK NEXT WEEK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Raws for this chapter this Thursday&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;English scans for this chapter this Friday&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scans for 1038 will release on 28th Jan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "content": "The first time we see Sanji using Hell's Memories against Wadatsumi, it's more in line with the gag of Sanji having endured 2 years with the newkamas, and it had nothing to do with his past, so at the time we as an audience just saw it as a funny joke and a pretty cool new move. \n\nFast-forward to WCI where we get the backstory and learn about how traumatizing and harsh the shit that Sanji had to go through during his childhood actually was, and we start seeing him in a different light.\n\nAnd then finally, we come to Onigashima, where he's fighting Queen while also battling the thought of potentially turning into the very same monsters that abused him all those years ago. He decides to trust in himself instead, and after hearing enough from Queen rambling on and on about that which he hates, he finally unleashes Hell's Memories for the second time. But **THIS** time it holds much more weight, and we feel it. We, the audience, now know about his past, and the thought of Sanji using the memories of those hellish times as his weapon after finally having overcome his trauma is so fucking badass and powerful. It's almost like the attack itself evolved.\n\nI remember thinking about all this the first time I read the chapter and it just blew me away. To think that Goda lowkey had a good idea of what was in store for Sanji after showcasing Hell's memories in Fishman Island all the way up until this point and executing it as well as he did is just insane.\n\nFelt like it was an underrated feat and not many people were talking about it so thought I'd just rant by myself. Then again, it could also be that it's really obvious and I'm just dumb. Either way, one of the best story developments I've seen in One Piece so far.",

Besides, the power to manipulate people's body against their will is usually a power used by villains, and his flamboyant design, laugh and demeanor had a menacing feel to it. \n\nAt Marineford, he wasn't fighing for any cause, you could simply see he was there to enjoy and revel in the carnage. That was glimpse into the kind of person he was. \n\nNormally a backstory is sometimes used to make a character sympathetic and show how they became what they are, but his showed that he was evil right from his childhood, being a celestial dragon and all, and just showed how he grew in power. \n\nEven without his fruit, he is highly manipulative and charismatic. He manipulated the World government, the Country of Dressrosa, and the Pirate world. He talks about loyalty and family but won't think twice about discarding any of his crew as he killed his own biological brother like he did to their father cuz he felt they betrayed him, and his last conversations with Monet and Vergo were he convinced them that dying for his sake was the best thing they could do also shows that. \n\nA lot of time, good Villians can fall into the trap of being cool and rooted for by people over the less interesting heroes (Madara), but while everything about Doffy might appear cool, you still don't want to root for him, and you still remember he is an evil SOB that enjoys doing horrible things to people.\n\nKaido might be stronger but he respects his opponents and recently, he doesn't feel as menancing as Doffy was to be honest, as the fight with Luffy now feels like a sparring match. Honestly I believe Doffy being afraid of Kaido was just to hype up Kaido, as alot of people in Wano have been shown not to be scared of him, even his own crew. Big Mom might be stronger but she is just Batshit crazy and comical alot of the time. Katakuri might be stronger but he was Noble and his fight with Luffy felt like a fight where luffy was suppose to grow in preparation for his battles against the Yonkos. Lucci and Akainu are not villains in the true sense of the world, just marines following orders and their own extreme version of justice. Blackbeard might be the final villain, but he is just the other coin side of Luffy, working towards the same goals to be pirate King like Luffy, but going about it like a real life pirate would, but Doffy doesn't even have such goals or want to be pirate King, He just wants to see the world burn for how he was brought down from his place as a Celestial dragon. Normally when a villain says that, it can be generic, but with Doflamingo, it's very fitting. . Crocodile was someone who could be comparable to Doflamingo in his first appearance due to similar scenerios but he fell into the cool trap where some people rooted for him over Luffy (Okay this is just me), and he was Luffy's first test in the series, and he also later got redeemed from Impel down by helping Luffy to escape from prison and at Marineford, and for caring about Dan Baz when Mihawk was messing him up. Even though Crocodile might have done the same exact thing to Alabasta that Doffy did to Dressrosa, the fact that we never see Crocodile reveling and enjoying such suffering like Doffy, visually makes him seem less awfully than Doffy. Unlike with Crocodile where you wondered how Luffy would beat a Warlord, with Doffy, you just wanted to see Luffy kick his ass badly. He was the perfect perfect for Gear 4 to make its debut against. \n\nSo personally Doflamingo is the most menancing Villain in OP. Even while locked up in Marineford, you can't help but feel his menance and presence in there, and know that he is not redeemable, rather will cause even greater problems if he ever escapes.",

    "content": "Hello, I have done balancing and game tips before so I think I know what I\u2019m talking about. Here is what I think each agent could use in terms of buff or a nerf. The format will go as follows:\n\nAGENT [BUFF/NERF] - I explain the nerf or buff here\n\nASTRA [NERF] - lock anybody from playing Astra below diamond elo (ur not that guy pal I am sorry). There is a work around for this, however. If below diamond elo you must take a quick iq test and anybody over 250 can play her (that would be me. I\u2019m that guy pal)\n\nBREACH [BUFF] - Breach\u2019s flash instantly kills anyone who is blinded. He\u2019s not really seeing much playtime right now so maybe this will increase the pick rate.\n\nBRIMSTONE [NERF] - Brimstone is OLD. He needs to retired he is not a hot anime girl so I see no need to have him in the game\n\nCHAMBER [BUFF] - Make Chamber not french as it seems everybody who picks him wants to surrender by round 5. Also more lore please on why his yu gi oh cards tp him...\n\nCYPHER [BUFF] - Cypher's cam can now fly and is invincible and invisible and does not let the person who is tagged know they are tagged. Also every round cypher follows the lore and gets domed round start.\n\nJETT [NERF] - Allow more than one person to play Jett on a team per game. This will cull instalock throwers (ME) who will never got Jett because they do not know how to click fast.\n\nKAY/O [BUFF] - Please add voice lines for KAY/O where he talks about being Killjoy's sex robot that's the only way I could see KAY/O ever being a viable option imo.\n\nKILLJOY [NERF] - Killjoy's stupid fucking turret shoots Killjoy and one shots her for putting it in stupid cross fire angles on pistol round bc it takes a million shots to kill the stupid fucking turret.\n\nNEON [BUFF] - This is speculation, but I think she should have a 100% speed boost all the time so that real overwatch players have something to do beside complain about how slow this game is compared to overwatch.\n\nOMEN [BUFF] - as an Omen main who instalocks Jett/Reyna, Omen should be able to dash and, after every kill, he should get to use a new ability that allows him to kill a different enemy instantly for every enemy he kills.\n\nPHOENIX [NERF] - Get rid of his flame wall as it is an obvious copy of NEON's walls but it is only one. That or maybe be more original and make his wall perpendicular and impassible (maybe greenish/blueish as well bc orange is a yucky color)\n\nRAZE [NERF] - I hate Raze blast packs and abilities are too hard to understand, maybe give her a dash instead and instead of grenades maybe like an updraft type ability?\n\nREYNA [BUFF] - Reyna doesn't see a lot of play from my teammates as I usually instalock it so I wondered what would be the way to make them want to play her more? I think instead of a Q that heals, maybe after you Q a kill you instantly win the round?\n\nSAGE [BUFF] - Sage seems to tanky, maybe give her a dash instead of slows and since her wall ability is an obvious copy of Phoenix's new changes, maybe her wall will be replaced with an updraft type ability.\n\nSKYE [NERF] - I. CANT. SEE. WHEN. SKYE. FLASHES. Remove the flash effect from her stupid birds they don't help me at all when she is pushin the site I am holding.\n\nSOVA [BUFF] - Sova can not use any guns he can only use his bow since he talks so much shit saying he bow hunts squirrels and rabbits fuck you. HOW SOVA?? YOU DON'T USE REAL ARROWS!!!\n\nVIPER [BUFF] - Viper is all about poison clouds, but not ONE voice line is about her taking big farts!!!! CHANGE IT! Also the poison orb covers a whole site as the orb right now only usually covers one entrance. That sucks as usually they go through two different entrances.\n\nYORU [NERF] - Yoru, being the highest picked champ there is, needs a nerf. Make it so every time he tps he has a 40% chance of instantly dying because of cross dimensional rips or something idk it should be easy to explain why.\n\nDRCHOO [BUFF] - DRCHOO on valorant has been Gold 1 for literally every season he hasn't been silver 3 please change this as it seems the rank is too easy for him so he does not even try and loses (at least just give me like an immortal gun buddy so I can lie to my friends)\n\nWhat do you guys think about these changes? These were just off the top of my head so maybe balancing will be a little off still, but I think it is a step in the right direction.",
    "content_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I have done balancing and game tips before so I think I know what I\u2019m talking about. Here is what I think each agent could use in terms of buff or a nerf. The format will go as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AGENT [BUFF/NERF] - I explain the nerf or buff here&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ASTRA [NERF] - lock anybody from playing Astra below diamond elo (ur not that guy pal I am sorry). There is a work around for this, however. If below diamond elo you must take a quick iq test and anybody over 250 can play her (that would be me. I\u2019m that guy pal)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BREACH [BUFF] - Breach\u2019s flash instantly kills anyone who is blinded. He\u2019s not really seeing much playtime right now so maybe this will increase the pick rate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BRIMSTONE [NERF] - Brimstone is OLD. He needs to retired he is not a hot anime girl so I see no need to have him in the game&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CHAMBER [BUFF] - Make Chamber not french as it seems everybody who picks him wants to surrender by round 5. Also more lore please on why his yu gi oh cards tp him...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CYPHER [BUFF] - Cypher&amp;#39;s cam can now fly and is invincible and invisible and does not let the person who is tagged know they are tagged. Also every round cypher follows the lore and gets domed round start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;JETT [NERF] - Allow more than one person to play Jett on a team per game. This will cull instalock throwers (ME) who will never got Jett because they do not know how to click fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;KAY/O [BUFF] - Please add voice lines for KAY/O where he talks about being Killjoy&amp;#39;s sex robot that&amp;#39;s the only way I could see KAY/O ever being a viable option imo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;KILLJOY [NERF] - Killjoy&amp;#39;s stupid fucking turret shoots Killjoy and one shots her for putting it in stupid cross fire angles on pistol round bc it takes a million shots to kill the stupid fucking turret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NEON [BUFF] - This is speculation, but I think she should have a 100% speed boost all the time so that real overwatch players have something to do beside complain about how slow this game is compared to overwatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OMEN [BUFF] - as an Omen main who instalocks Jett/Reyna, Omen should be able to dash and, after every kill, he should get to use a new ability that allows him to kill a different enemy instantly for every enemy he kills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX [NERF] - Get rid of his flame wall as it is an obvious copy of NEON&amp;#39;s walls but it is only one. That or maybe be more original and make his wall perpendicular and impassible (maybe greenish/blueish as well bc orange is a yucky color)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RAZE [NERF] - I hate Raze blast packs and abilities are too hard to understand, maybe give her a dash instead and instead of grenades maybe like an updraft type ability?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;REYNA [BUFF] - Reyna doesn&amp;#39;t see a lot of play from my teammates as I usually instalock it so I wondered what would be the way to make them want to play her more? I think instead of a Q that heals, maybe after you Q a kill you instantly win the round?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SAGE [BUFF] - Sage seems to tanky, maybe give her a dash instead of slows and since her wall ability is an obvious copy of Phoenix&amp;#39;s new changes, maybe her wall will be replaced with an updraft type ability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SKYE [NERF] - I. CANT. SEE. WHEN. SKYE. FLASHES. Remove the flash effect from her stupid birds they don&amp;#39;t help me at all when she is pushin the site I am holding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SOVA [BUFF] - Sova can not use any guns he can only use his bow since he talks so much shit saying he bow hunts squirrels and rabbits fuck you. HOW SOVA?? YOU DON&amp;#39;T USE REAL ARROWS!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VIPER [BUFF] - Viper is all about poison clouds, but not ONE voice line is about her taking big farts!!!! CHANGE IT! Also the poison orb covers a whole site as the orb right now only usually covers one entrance. That sucks as usually they go through two different entrances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YORU [NERF] - Yoru, being the highest picked champ there is, needs a nerf. Make it so every time he tps he has a 40% chance of instantly dying because of cross dimensional rips or something idk it should be easy to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRCHOO [BUFF] - DRCHOO on valorant has been Gold 1 for literally every season he hasn&amp;#39;t been silver 3 please change this as it seems the rank is too easy for him so he does not even try and loses (at least just give me like an immortal gun buddy so I can lie to my friends)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think about these changes? These were just off the top of my head so maybe balancing will be a little off still, but I think it is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "title": "30-Day Challenge #1: Get on top of your credit (January, 2022)",
    "content": "# 30-day challenges\n\nWe are pleased to announce that we're continuing our 30-day challenge series. The schedule spans the entire year so be sure to keep an eye out each month.\n\nThis month's 30-day challenge is to **get on top of your credit.** Here are some concrete steps you can take:\n\n# Check your free credit report\n\nThere are three major credit bureaus in the US: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. These companies each gather credit histories for individuals and sell that information to credit card companies, lenders, and other financial institutions.\n\nYou can go to https://www.annualcreditreport.com to get a credit report from each credit bureau once per year. It's often recommended to stagger your requests so you can get one every four months so you may only want to request one report at this time. You can use a calendar reminder to stay on top of this.\n\nNow, your free credit report won't include your score and it also won't include credit monitoring, but you absolutely don't need to buy those from a credit bureau because there are free options. See below.\n\nNote that the security questions will sometimes ask about intentionally false information (e.g. made-up loans), so \"none of the above\" may be the right answer. If you can't get past the security questions, you may have to write in to get your report. Also be aware that you don't have to pay for anything on the credit bureau sites. If you find yourself prompted for a credit card number, you might have clicked to sign up for something you might not need or want.\n\nAlso, if you have trouble with the web site, try temporarily disabling browser ad-blockers and privacy extensions.\n\nSee the [Credit Reports Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_reports) for more information!\n\n# Sign up for free credit monitoring\n\nYou don't need to pay for credit monitoring. Some options:\n\n* A variety of companies such as [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) and [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) offer free credit monitoring services. [There's a longer list of options in our Wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico#wiki_how_can_i_get_my_fico_score_or_a_score_estimate_for_free.3F)\n\n* Many employers also offer free credit monitoring for their employees directly with a credit bureau. Check with your benefits department.\n\n* Finally, if you've been the victim of a data breach like Target or Anthem, those companies are providing free credit monitoring for anyone potentially affected.\n\nAfter exploring your options, sign up with at least one of them. More information contained in the [Credit Scoring Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico).\n\n# Find out your credit score\n\nYou can now [get your FICO score for free from Discover](https://www.creditscorecard.com/) without a credit card.\n\nIn addition, a number of credit cards actually give you a free FICO score as a benefit of having their card. Brands providing FICO scores include Discover, Citi (branded cards only), American Express, Bank of America, and Barclaycard. [Here's a full list of options.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico#wiki_how_can_i_get_my_fico_score_or_a_score_estimate_for_free.3F)\n\nIn addition, you can get your VantageScore from [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) or [Mint](https://www.mint.com/). VantageScore is used less often by creditors than FICO, but it's a *usually* a good estimate of your FICO score. Paying for your credit score is silly unless you're considering getting a major loan like a mortgage.\n\n# Get rid of pre-approved credit card junk mail\n\n[OptOutPrescreen.Com](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/) is the official consumer credit card reporting website to opt-out of offers of credit or insurance. It's an easy win to reduce junk mail and reduce the risk of identity theft (from someone stealing your mail). I recommend signing up unless you're in the process of building credit and actually want to receive pre-approved offers.\n\n# Are you looking to improve your credit?\n\nOnce you have a score over 740, most credit files are solid enough to qualify for prime rate lending. This means that any additional increase of your score will likely not get you better credit products.\n\nIf you are in a position where you'd like to improve your credit, here are two situations that often befall people when asking for help here:\n\n* [\"I have no credit, and I am looking to get started.\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_no_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_get_started.)\n* [\"I have bad credit, and I am looking to repair it.\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_bad_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_repair_it.)\n\n# What to do if you find information you don't recognize\n\nEven though credit reporting is automated, mistakes can still occur. The most common errors can involve names and addresses. If your name is similar to a parent's name, there are also instances where a line of credit is reported on the wrong file.\n\nThe simplest course of action is to dispute the information with the bureaus. Here are direct links to initiate a dispute:\n\n* [Equifax](https://experian.referral.equifax.com/CreditInvestigation/home.action)\n* [Experian](http://www.experian.com/disputes/main.html)\n* [TransUnion](https://onlinedispute.transunion.com/disputewizard/)\n\nFinally, if you believe you've had your identity stolen, read and follow the steps in our **[Identity Theft Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft)**.\n\n# If you're not in the United States\n\n[The PF wiki has many more countries covered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_reports#wiki_what_if_i.27m_not_in_the_united_states.3F) If you would like to add information for your country to the wiki, please message the moderation team.\n\n# Challenge success criteria\n\nYou've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 3 or more of the following things:\n\n* Requested a free credit report via annualcreditreport.com\n* Set a reminder to request a different credit report in 4 months\n* Found out your credit score (either FICO or VantageScore)\n* Signed up for free credit monitoring\n* Opted out of pre-screened offers\n* Initiated a credit dispute with one or more credit bureaus\n\nIf you're outside of the US, you've successfully completed this challenge once you've done the following things:\n\n* Read up on whether there is a credit scoring system in your country and find out how it works (see the previous section and also try searching the internet).\n* If it exists, find out how you can get information about your own report or score or whatever it's called, get that information if possible, and check it for accuracy.\n* If there are items on there that you can try to fix, start doing so. For example: pay down debts, talk to the credit reporting agency about inaccurate items, etc.",

If you find yourself prompted for a credit card number, you might have clicked to sign up for something you might not need or want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you have trouble with the web site, try temporarily disabling browser ad-blockers and privacy extensions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_reports\"&gt;Credit Reports Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for more information!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Sign up for free credit monitoring&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need to pay for credit monitoring. Some options:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A variety of companies such as &lt;a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/\"&gt;Credit Karma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\"&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt; offer free credit monitoring services. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico#wiki_how_can_i_get_my_fico_score_or_a_score_estimate_for_free.3F\"&gt;There&amp;#39;s a longer list of options in our Wiki.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many employers also offer free credit monitoring for their employees directly with a credit bureau. Check with your benefits department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you&amp;#39;ve been the victim of a data breach like Target or Anthem, those companies are providing free credit monitoring for anyone potentially affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After exploring your options, sign up with at least one of them. More information contained in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico\"&gt;Credit Scoring Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Find out your credit score&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can now &lt;a href=\"https://www.creditscorecard.com/\"&gt;get your FICO score for free from Discover&lt;/a&gt; without a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, a number of credit cards actually give you a free FICO score as a benefit of having their card. Brands providing FICO scores include Discover, Citi (branded cards only), American Express, Bank of America, and Barclaycard. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico#wiki_how_can_i_get_my_fico_score_or_a_score_estimate_for_free.3F\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a full list of options.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, you can get your VantageScore from &lt;a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/\"&gt;Credit Karma&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\"&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt;. VantageScore is used less often by creditors than FICO, but it&amp;#39;s a &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; a good estimate of your FICO score. Paying for your credit score is silly unless you&amp;#39;re considering getting a major loan like a mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Get rid of pre-approved credit card junk mail&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.optoutprescreen.com/\"&gt;OptOutPrescreen.Com&lt;/a&gt; is the official consumer credit card reporting website to opt-out of offers of credit or insurance. It&amp;#39;s an easy win to reduce junk mail and reduce the risk of identity theft (from someone stealing your mail). I recommend signing up unless you&amp;#39;re in the process of building credit and actually want to receive pre-approved offers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Are you looking to improve your credit?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have a score over 740, most credit files are solid enough to qualify for prime rate lending. This means that any additional increase of your score will likely not get you better credit products.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are in a position where you&amp;#39;d like to improve your credit, here are two situations that often befall people when asking for help here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_no_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_get_started.\"&gt;&amp;quot;I have no credit, and I am looking to get started.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_bad_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_repair_it.\"&gt;&amp;quot;I have bad credit, and I am looking to repair it.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What to do if you find information you don&amp;#39;t recognize&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though credit reporting is automated, mistakes can still occur. The most common errors can involve names and addresses. If your name is similar to a parent&amp;#39;s name, there are also instances where a line of credit is reported on the wrong file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The simplest course of action is to dispute the information with the bureaus. Here are direct links to initiate a dispute:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://experian.referral.equifax.com/CreditInvestigation/home.action\"&gt;Equifax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.experian.com/disputes/main.html\"&gt;Experian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://onlinedispute.transunion.com/disputewizard/\"&gt;TransUnion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you believe you&amp;#39;ve had your identity stolen, read and follow the steps in our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft\"&gt;Identity Theft Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not in the United States&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_reports#wiki_what_if_i.27m_not_in_the_united_states.3F\"&gt;The PF wiki has many more countries covered.&lt;/a&gt; If you would like to add information for your country to the wiki, please message the moderation team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Challenge success criteria&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve successfully completed this challenge once you&amp;#39;ve done 3 or more of the following things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Requested a free credit report via annualcreditreport.com&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set a reminder to request a different credit report in 4 months&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Found out your credit score (either FICO or VantageScore)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Signed up for free credit monitoring&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Opted out of pre-screened offers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Initiated a credit dispute with one or more credit bureaus&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re outside of the US, you&amp;#39;ve successfully completed this challenge once you&amp;#39;ve done the following things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Read up on whether there is a credit scoring system in your country and find out how it works (see the previous section and also try searching the internet).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If it exists, find out how you can get information about your own report or score or whatever it&amp;#39;s called, get that information if possible, and check it for accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If there are items on there that you can try to fix, start doing so. For example: pay down debts, talk to the credit reporting agency about inaccurate items, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "content": "Since my mother divorced my father, she has spent years working hard to get out of debt. This year is the year she will succeed and have 0 debt - no car payment, no credit cards, etc. Rent has gone up so much in the last couple of years, she's considering alternative options. Let me give you some details about her....\n\nShe's single; has one elderly cat and does not want any more pets; loves to be near the city (not a big city) and work; works from home 90% of the time; has 0 handyman skills, but does have my fiance and I that can do almost anything; She has never owned a home before; currently rents a 2br apartment at $630 per month and is month-to-month. Her credit is excellent and her salary is near 50K. She does not have retirement though.\n\nShe just received an email that rent will be going up an additional $145 per month ($775 total) and they are requiring 12 month leases from now on. I suggested she try to sign before the $145 goes in effect and she said they will not; she would have to sign at the higher rate. She isn't quite out of debt yet, so she thinks she will be signing a 12 month lease to go ahead and finish getting out of debt then considering what her next steps will be. She would like a place to live with 2 bedrooms.\n\nHere are some of the thoughts she has considered:\n\n* Buying a NEW mobile or modular home and\n   * Either buying a small lot of land to put it on or\n   * Putting it on my land (more details below)\n* Buying a house\n* Continuing renting\n\nSo let's go into more details about the possibility of her purchasing a mobile or modular home. She does not want to go in a 'trailer park'. She would like to either buy a lot of land or possibly put it on my land. She does not like that I live out of the city by 20 minutes, but it would be free for her once set up. However, she would need to have a septic line dug to connect to my septic, water line to mine or a new one, and would need to have electricty hooked up. I have two electricity hookups on my property, one is to my main house and apartment and the second goes to my sheds but I have it disconnected so she could use that one and be on her own separate meter. I also don't have a trailer pad so she'd need that too. She fears that I could miss my mortgage payments or go into foreclosure and she would be screwed because her home was on my land. I told her even though that is very unlikely, if it DID happen she could just move her mobile home elsewhere.\n\nIf she were to buy a lot of land, she asked me if the loan could be combined into one loan - for her to buy a mobile/modular home, a lot of land, and have all of the connection and setup costs put in to one large loan. I said I have no idea. I told her I knew there were loans for building new houses, but I didn't know if those could work for this. Lots of land around here are quite cheap - 20K-50K according to size and location.\n\nNext would to be buying an existing house, not modular or mobile home. Housing prices in the areas she is looking at are around 150K-200K for what she wants. She does not want to live in a \"low quality neighborhood\" or far out of town. The pros are she wouldn't have to pay for a lot of hookups and construction, but the cons are you never know when something is going to break when it's not brand new and under warranty. I suggested that regardless of what she does (buying a new or existing home) she needs to get a home warranty for the first year at least.\n\nFinally, she could just continue renting. However, she did say she will not be moving to find a cheaper rent - if she moves, she wants it to be into a 'permanent' home that she is buying and that is hers. She hates moving and doesn't want to keep repeating this every 2-3 years.\n\nNow, I'd like Reddit's advice and wisdom. I just went through the process of buying a home and so I know some of it and want to help her out, but I know there's far more than what I know, and I know enough to know that I made some serious mistakes when buying my home that I don't want her to make. Here are some of the bits of knowledge and advice I've given her...\n\n1. There are first time home buyer loans and downpayment assistant loans that she may qualify for. She does not have a downpayment saved.\n2. She will need to buy home insurance on top of the mortgage - and it costs more than renters insurance.\n3. Home warranty is different than home insurance, but I believe that not-new homes need a home warranty for at least a year to help with unexpected break downs.\n4. It is more difficult to buy a used mobile home on land - and most banks want to finance it as a 20 year or less loan rather than a 30 year conventional, but it isn't impossible, as that's what mine is financed as.\n\nHere are some questions she and I have....\n\n1. Can she get a loan to cover buying a mobile/modular home and associated costs of hookup, connections, and construction? Can she also include buying land in that same loan?\n2. In the grand scheme of things, is buying a place going to cost more in repairs, insurance, and anything else than it would be to just continue renting?\n\nWill add more as I think of it... thanks in advanced!",

    "content": "I have read in this forum that I-Bond rates change every six months (true), and that future rates could be anything (technically true). I decided to look at how rates are calculated and think that they can at least be predicted somewhat. The first thing to note is that there is a base rate (been 0 for a long time) plus inflation. (Non-seasonally adjusted CPI-U increase from Sep to Mar or vice versa which is doubled to be an annual rate) For the March\u201922 rate we already have three months of data (Oct-Nov-Dec), and have seen 1.62% inflation in that period. I think the worst case (if you want high I-Bond rates) would be no more inflation for the next three months, and if that happens, I project the I-bond rate to be 3.25% (0+1.62*2) for March. My mid case would be that the next three months of inflation are roughly average to what we have seen since March\u201919 (as far back as I bothered to get data), which is 0.28%/month; given this assumption we would see an I-Bond rate of 5%. The best case would be that we continue to see inflation like we have seen since Mar\u201921 (when inflation really took off), which is 0.58%/month; if that happens, we will see an I-bond rate of 6.75%.\n\nThere is still a ton of variation in my low (3.25%), mid (5%) and high (6.75%) models. I would point out that every month we get new data the models will narrow, this months 5 +/- 1.75, will be next months 5 +- 1.25 etc. For me this model has been helpful because it leaves me projecting that I will be putting another $10K in I bonds in 2022 because I can\u2019t find any comparable interest rate anywhere else at the mid and high models, and it would be a lot of work to find it even on the low side.\n\nIf anyone else knows more about this than I do, and has advice for how to fix and/or improve they way I am looking at this, please let me know.",

I would point out that every month we get new data the models will narrow, this months 5 +/- 1.75, will be next months 5 +- 1.25 etc. For me this model has been helpful because it leaves me projecting that I will be putting another $10K in I bonds in 2022 because I can\u2019t find any comparable interest rate anywhere else at the mid and high models, and it would be a lot of work to find it even on the low side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone else knows more about this than I do, and has advice for how to fix and/or improve they way I am looking at this, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "content": "Hi all. I originally posted this in r/askcarsales but I think PF makes more sense.\n\nI paid off my leased 2019 Hyundai Kona on 9/29/2021. I have the \"paid in full\" letter. I requested the title right away, and I gave Hyundai Motor Finance my FedEx account number over the phone so that they could hopefully expedite it. Instead, they claim to have sent it out through US mail, ok fine, but it never arrived. One rep I spoke to said that she saw it was returned to them on 10/30/2021, but then later they said there was no record of the title being returned to them. They claim to have sent a letter of no interest on 11/8/2021. Again, it never arrived. On 12/6/2021 my mom sent via certified mail a letter requesting a duplicate title along with a check for $15 made out to the Virginia DMV, as instructed by the \"special agent\" I spoke to in customer service (I moved to the UK in October, hence why my mom is helping out from afar). The letter was signed for at the address he gave me on 12/13/2021. I called yesterday to ask about the status since the check had not been cashed, and the same special agent said that they have no record of receiving the letter/check. He said he would email the titles department and that I should call back in five business days.\n\nI am so frustrated and feeling really helpless. The DMV told me that since the title was never transferred to me, Hyundai is still responsible for requesting a duplicate. I asked the special agent what the next step is if they don't locate the letter/check and he didn't have an answer. I am not sure how to further escalate this. Do you think it would make sense to file a complaint with CFPB? Thanks in advance for any advice.",

I also don&amp;#39;t have equity with the car. i&amp;#39;ve had it for about 10 months, and I don&amp;#39;t even really want it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been told by the company that I work for that I could see my first check after 3 to 4 weeks. it&amp;#39;s a fully commission based job as well, so I rely on getting sales to actually make money, so there is no hourly wage. I&amp;#39;m not sure how well I will do so I thought that I could maybe sell my car, get a few thousand from it  continue to pay off the debt and also hopefully tie me over while I&amp;#39;m not making money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i just want to know if this could hurt me in the long run. any advice would be appreciated thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Even top projects wait for months to get audited by Dapp.org. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://Dapp.org\"&gt;Dapp.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s Uniswap V2 audit report still sets the standard in the space for a quality code audit: &lt;a href=\"https://dapp.org.uk/reports/uniswapv2.html\"&gt;https://dapp.org.uk/reports/uniswapv2.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trail of Bits is another reckoned audit firm that has not only audited top projects but also disclosed vulnerabilities in cryptography signature schemes. &lt;a href=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2021/12/21/disclosing-shamirs-secret-sharing-vulnerabilities-and-announcing-zkdocs/\"&gt;https://blog.trailofbits.com/2021/12/21/disclosing-shamirs-secret-sharing-vulnerabilities-and-announcing-zkdocs/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to shitty audit firms, just like to CertiK, Peckshield is another audit firm that has had its projects hacked. Eg: Cover protocol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The below is a tier list of some audit firms that you can use to rate various projects:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tier 1 (The best):  Dapp.org, Trail of Bits&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tier 2: Chain Security, Runtime Verification and ABDK&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tier 3: Kudelski, Open Zeppelin, ConsenSys, Quantstamp&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tier F: (Terrible): CertiK, Peckshield &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its not an extensive list, but make sure you do research on the audit firm before relying on any such statement that shitcoin XYZ was audited by DAB. There are even more terrible audit reports coming in these days&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This one is a broad generalized sense of what I got in the comments, I know there are cases otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps, Dapps, and a bunch of other terms.&lt;/strong&gt; So, a lot of people seem to take it as a jab, because it seems like it gets used as a jab, to overly summarize it by saying &amp;#39;most crypto applications, are applications built on crypto to help you trade crypto?&amp;#39;. But, for the most part, that seems pretty true. For now at least.  It seems like the real application of Dapps has yet to be realized. Which I want to clarify, I don&amp;#39;t think totally discredits them, nobody could imagine any of the applications of early era internet environments. Just makes it hard to figure out what&amp;#39;s going on. (Also I&amp;#39;m just talking majority of cases here. there ARE, some apps that aren&amp;#39;t just for moving crypto around more efficiently, but my understanding is still too caveman to have brought them up.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

    "content": "Hey guys, Im Spragg, I do deep dives into various different coins/tokens on youtube and thought since I've already scripted them for the video's Id post a summarised version here, for anyone interested here's a link to the full video version: [**https://youtu.be/ivC6lTkt688**](https://youtu.be/ivC6lTkt688)\n\n# Preface\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Ethereum has scalability issues in it\u2019s current state with gas fees growing to the point that buying a $5 .ETH domain will run you over 300 dollars in gas fees, but implementing a solution to this, like Ethereum itself, will be a slow process. This problem is only going to continue to get worse with more and more Dapps being created and the network getting more and more congested. However, back in 2017 a team comprised of Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and business consultant Anurag Arjun, identified this fundamental problem with Ethereum and set out to create MATIC.\n\n## What is Polygon?\n\nTo call Polygon just a layer 2 is somewhat of a disservice however with Plasma side chains, EVM sidechains, and a view to implementing even more layer 2 approaches like Optimistic Rollups which is where the scalability of Plasma would be sacrificed but they could provide a side chain running and OVM, or optimistic virtual machine, which would allow the side chain to run any application that Ethereum can run.\n\nPolygon works by having 3 distinct layers, Bor, the block production layer, Heimdall, the proof of stake layer, and then the smart contracts built on Ethereum itself.\n\nStarting with Bor, this layers sole responsibility is to take transactions made on the Polygon network and aggregate them into blocks for validation. To select block producers all of the validators are given slots depending on their total stake, this then builds a pool of slots for the chain to choose from. Then, this pool is shuffled and then producers are selected from the resulting pool, with the number varying depending on how many are required for that sprint.\n\nOnce the blocks have been created its on Heimdall to validate those blocks and perform the checkpointing. After a certain number of blocks have been produced by BOR, a validator within the Heimdall layer will be tasked with validating those blocks, building a hash tree out of them and then publishes that tree back to the main chain for ratification.\n\nSince the staking is actually performed via the Ethereum smart contract, the Polygon chain security is inherited from Ethereum, which means that dishonest validators wouldn\u2019t be enough to take the network down.\n\n## Polygon Name Change\n\nAs I mentioned previously, Polygon\u2019s goal within the crypto space is to provide an internet of blockchains on top of the Ethereum, and in the future other basechains.

    "content_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, Im Spragg, I do deep dives into various different coins/tokens on youtube and thought since I&amp;#39;ve already scripted them for the video&amp;#39;s Id post a summarised version here, for anyone interested here&amp;#39;s a link to the full video version: &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/ivC6lTkt688\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://youtu.be/ivC6lTkt688&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Preface&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s no secret that Ethereum has scalability issues in it\u2019s current state with gas fees growing to the point that buying a $5 .ETH domain will run you over 300 dollars in gas fees, but implementing a solution to this, like Ethereum itself, will be a slow process. This problem is only going to continue to get worse with more and more Dapps being created and the network getting more and more congested. However, back in 2017 a team comprised of Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and business consultant Anurag Arjun, identified this fundamental problem with Ethereum and set out to create MATIC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What is Polygon?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To call Polygon just a layer 2 is somewhat of a disservice however with Plasma side chains, EVM sidechains, and a view to implementing even more layer 2 approaches like Optimistic Rollups which is where the scalability of Plasma would be sacrificed but they could provide a side chain running and OVM, or optimistic virtual machine, which would allow the side chain to run any application that Ethereum can run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Polygon works by having 3 distinct layers, Bor, the block production layer, Heimdall, the proof of stake layer, and then the smart contracts built on Ethereum itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting with Bor, this layers sole responsibility is to take transactions made on the Polygon network and aggregate them into blocks for validation. To select block producers all of the validators are given slots depending on their total stake, this then builds a pool of slots for the chain to choose from. Then, this pool is shuffled and then producers are selected from the resulting pool, with the number varying depending on how many are required for that sprint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the blocks have been created its on Heimdall to validate those blocks and perform the checkpointing. After a certain number of blocks have been produced by BOR, a validator within the Heimdall layer will be tasked with validating those blocks, building a hash tree out of them and then publishes that tree back to the main chain for ratification.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the staking is actually performed via the Ethereum smart contract, the Polygon chain security is inherited from Ethereum, which means that dishonest validators wouldn\u2019t be enough to take the network down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Polygon Name Change&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned previously, Polygon\u2019s goal within the crypto space is to provide an internet of blockchains on top of the Ethereum, and in the future other basechains.

    "title": "Ultimate guide to crypto terms, slang, and acronyms!",
    "content": "Welcome newbies, veterans, experts and everyone in between! I wanted to attempt to make an ultimate guide to terms, slang, and acronyms that are most commonly used across the crypto world! \n\nHopefully this helps someone better understand some things!\n\n**This list is broken up into three sections:**\n\n1. Terms\n2. Acronyms\n3. Slang\n\n# 1. Terms\n\n* **Address** \\- A crypto address is a string of characters that represents a wallet that can send and receive cryptocurrency. It is likened to a real-life address, email or website. Every address is unique and denotes the location of a wallet on the blockchain.\n* **Altcoin** \\- A portmanteau of \u201calternative\u201d and \u201ccoin\u201d, altcoin generally refers to any cryptocurrency other than the original one, bitcoin.\n* **Blockchain** \\- A digital form of record keeping, and the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies. A blockchain is the result of sequential blocks that build upon one another, creating a permanent and unchangeable ledger of transactions (or other data).\n* **Bull markets and bear markets** \\- These are phrases borrowed from traditional stock markets. A bull market means traders are confident in the prospects for a particular investment, meaning they will keep buying and prices will keep rising \u2013 whereas in a bear market, traders are nervous and prices will generally fall.\n   * *BULLISH:* An expectation that price is going to increase\n   * *BEARISH:* An expectation that price is going to decrease\n* **Cloud mining** \\- People can \u201cmine\u201d, or create, cryptocurrencies to compete for rewards in the form of newly minted crypto. Cloud mining uses remote data centers with shared processing power, like the kind that powers Google software, to pool resources and cut the cost of mining. Be extremely wary, as many cloud mining companies are just scams. An incredible amount of computing power is needed to mine the top cryptocurrencies. Anyone offering easy cloud-mining rewards is likely to be a charlatan.\n* **Cryptocurrency exchanges** \\- Just like regular stock exchanges, the likes of Coinbase, Binance, Gemini and Bitstamp allow traders and investors to buy and sell \u2014 except that here they are trading cryptocurrencies. Unlike standard stock markets, cryptocurrency exchanges are online-only and are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n* **DeFi** \\- is short for \u201cdecentralized finance,\u201d an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain geared toward disrupting financial intermediaries. DeFi draws inspiration from blockchain, the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, which allows several entities to hold a copy of a history of transactions, meaning it isn't controlled by a single, central source. That's important because centralized systems and human gatekeepers can limit the speed and sophistication of transactions while offering users less direct control over their money. DeFi is distinct because it expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial use cases.\n* **Decentralized Applications (DApps)** \\- Applications designed by developers and deployed on a blockchain to carry out actions without intermediaries. Decentralized finance activities are often completed using decentralized apps. Ethereum is the main network supporting activities in decentralized finance.\n* **Exchange** \\- A digital marketplace where you can buy and sell cryptocurrency.\n* **Fiat** \\- A fiat currency is one that is backed by a sovereign government. For instance, sterling, US dollars or Indian rupees.\n* **Forks** \\- A cryptocurrency fork is a split in a blockchain where two separate blockchains are created. This is sometimes but not always because of a disagreement between developers as to how the blockchain should be organized. In 2017, bitcoin forked into two separate blockchains: bitcoin and bitcoin cash.\n* **Gas (or Gas Fee)** \\- Gas in crypto refers to the computational effort required to execute operations. You must pay a gas fee in order to make a transaction or execute a smart contract on Ethereum.\n* **Limits** \\- Most exchanges do not set limits or restrictions on the number of cryptocurrency trades their users can make in a day. On turbulent trading days, when cryptocurrency prices are moving up or down very quickly, some brokers may put a short-term halt on people depositing funds on their platforms.\n* **Margin trading** \\- When platforms talk about margin trading, they mean investors borrow money to increase their bet on a cryptocurrency. Be very careful, though, because margin trading can dramatically exacerbate losses if a trade doesn\u2019t go your way.\n* **Market Cap** \\- Crypto market capitalization is the total value of a cryptocurrency. Where stock market capitalization is calculated by multiplying share price times shares outstanding, crypto market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price of the cryptocurrency with the number of coins in circulation.\n* **Order book** \\- An order book is a list of all the traders on a particular cryptocurrency exchange or brokerage who want to buy or sell cryptocurrency for a certain price\n* **Sell orders** \\- A sell order is an instruction given by traders to a platform to sell cryptocurrency that they own when the price hits a certain level. In traditional markets, this is referred to as a \u201cstop loss\u201d.\n* **Smart Contract** \\- An algorithmic program that enacts the terms of a contract automatically based on its code. One of the main value propositions of the Ethereum network is its ability to execute smart contracts.\n* **Staking** \\- Staking cryptocurrencies is a process that involves committing your crypto assets to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions. It's available with cryptocurrencies that use the proof-of-stake model to process payments. This is a more energy-efficient alternative to the proof-of-work model, which requires mining devices that use computing power to solve mathematical equations. Staking can be a great way to use your crypto to generate passive income, especially because some cryptocurrencies offer high interest rates for staking. Before you get started, it's important to fully understand how crypto staking works.\n* **Wallets** \\- a crypto wallet is a way to store your cryptocurrency\n   * *Hot Wallet* \\- A software-based cryptocurrency wallet connected to the Internet. While more convenient for quickly accessing your crypto, these wallets are a bit more susceptible to hacking and cybersecurity attacks than offline wallets \u2014 just as files you store in the cloud may be more easily hacked than those locked in a safe in your home.\n   * *Cold Wallet/Cold Storage* \\- A secure method of storing your cryptocurrency completely offline. Many cold wallets (also called hardware wallets) are physical devices that look similar to a USB drive. This kind of wallet can help protect your crypto from hacking and theft, though it also comes with its own risks \u2013 like losing it, along with your crypto.\n\n# 2. Acronyms\n\n* **ATH** \\- Short form for \u201cAll-Time High\u201d. Therefore it means the highest historical price of a specific coin.\n* **DCA** \\- Short for Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase.\n* **DYOR** \\- Do Your Own Research is regarded as one of the most important aspects of being a cryptocurrency investor. As a way of combatting fraud and bad financial advice, people are urged to \u2018DYOR\u2019 and investigate any potential investment fully before committing money to any project.\n* **FOMO** \\- Short for \u2018fear of missing out\u2019. The feeling when you see a huge green percentage growth on a chart and you don\u2019t own that coin, so you sell other shit to buy into it freaking out. As crypto trading is still very much driven by emotions rather than valuation, FOMO is a huge factor to consider when swing trading in crypto.\n* **FUD** \\- An acronym that stands for \u201cFear, Uncertainty and Doubt.\u201d It is a strategy to influence perception of certain cryptocurrencies or the cryptocurrency market in general by spreading negative, misleading or false information.\n* **HODL** \\- A misspelling of \u2018hold\u2019 that stuck around to mean \u2018keep\u2019. Also stands as an acronym for \"Hold On for Dear Life\". A crypto trader who buys a coin and does not plan on selling in the foreseeable future is called a hodler of the coin.\n* **ICO** \\- An ICO is an initial coin offering, like an initial public offering (IPO), or float, in the stocks and shares world. An ICO is where new cryptos are sold to investors for the first time.\n* **NFT** \\- Non-fungible token, which more or less means that it\u2019s unique and can\u2019t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible \u2014 trade one for another bitcoin, and you\u2019ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you\u2019d have something completely different. You gave up a Squirtle, and got a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, which StadiumTalk calls \u201cthe Mona Lisa of baseball cards.\u201d\n\n# 3. Slang\n\n* **Diamond Hands** \\- refers to someone who has a high-risk tolerance for a high volatility coin that they own. They don't cave under pressure and sell their coins, essentially.\n* **Lambo or \"when Lambo\u201d**\\- Is a slang for the type of exotic car that people aspire to buy when their crypto assets rise in value substantially, i.e. \u201cmoon\u201d.\n* **Moon or \"to the moon!\"** \\- A term that is often employed as a verb (mooning) to describe a cryptocurrency that is under a strong upward market trend. Another common use of the expression is in the phrase \u201c*to the moon,*\u201d which refers to a strong belief that certain cryptocurrency is soon going to rise significantly in price.\n* **Shill** \\- is used when a person promotes a specific digital coin or blockchain project. Shilling in the world of cryptocurrencies is part of a marketing ploy to bring awareness to certain coins that may or may not hold any value. This is why investors are advised to DYOR.\n* **Shorting** \\- \u201cShorting\u201d cryptocurrency means betting on the price going down rather than up.\n* **Weak Hands or Paper Hands** \\- Refers to people that panic sell instead of continuing to HODL as the value of a coin or the whole crypto market goes down.\n* **Whale** \\- A huge player who has a substantial amount of capital. Whales are said to have the ability to be market movers for small alt-coins too due to their huge capital.",

    "content": "In December, monthly inflation in the US was a bit higher than expected, reaching 0.5%, while the annual inflation increased to 7% and was the same as expected.\n\nEconomists expected that the consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of consumer prices released by the US Labor Department, will show that inflation jumped by 0.4% in December and 7% year-over-year \u2013 the highest increase in prices since 1982.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) moved up after the numbers were released, jumping from USD 43,400 to USD 43,900 in several minutes, and increasing its daily gains to around 5%. Ethereum (ETH) also moved up, surpassing USD 3,375 and increasing daily gains to 8%. \n\nWhile economists disagree on when inflation will peak, it\u2019s well past the initial time frame the Federal Reserve (Fed) had expected to see. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the Fed in panic instead of patient mode, so the risk is overshooting... We\u2019re now in a position of the Fed chasing instead of anticipating. It\u2019s worrisome,\u201d Diane Swonk, Chief Economist at Grant Thornton, told CNBC.\n\nAccording to Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the UKUK-based based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, there may be a selloff in the crypto market if the inflation numbers are larger than expected. This, however, shouldn\u2019t be a long event, \u201cas I suspect the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario due to the persistent selling recently,\u201d he wrote in an emailed note before the CPI numbers were released.\n\n\nSotiriou argued that the on-chain data is \u201cgenerally bullish,\u201d and that it suggests that these prices could be a buying opportunity, adding:\n\n\u201cBitcoin has entered the buy zone for dormancy flow, which has only flashed 5 times in Bitcoin\u2019s history, which all lead to incredible rallies. This indicator compares Bitcoin\u2019s market cap to the annual value of destruction \u2013 in layman\u2019s terms it compares price to spending behavior. As the percentage of people spending their bitcoin is so low. It shows the sentiment of investors, unwilling to sell their bitcoin at this price.\u201d\n\nAs reported, yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said during his confirmation hearing that \u2018we probably remain in an era of very low interest rates.\u2019\n\nShould he be given another term, argues the founder and CEO of Quantum Economics Mati Greenspan, Powell \u201cwill retain his position as the key figure at the helm of the great money printer.\u201d Rather than the statements, it is his \u201cboring presence on the stage\u201d and his \u201cfamiliar monotonous message\u201d of the economy being able to handle the COVID 19\u2019s Omicron variant while gradually reducing quantitative easing and preparing to eventually raise interest rates \u2013 that helped alleviate investors\u2019 concerns and put them at ease.\n\n\u201cIt's also important to keep in mind that the markets have declined a lot lately, so they are more than due for an upside correction,\u201d Greenspan wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, the inflation came in lower than expected.
